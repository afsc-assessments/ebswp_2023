Warning 1 : Turn Benchmark on because Forecast needs it
Warning 2 : Change SPR_reporting to 4 because benchmarks are off
Note 1 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Warning 3 : Minimum pop size bin:_10; is > L at Amin for sex: 1; Gpat: 1; L= 5
Warning 4 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 1.48926e-06; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 5 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
Warning 6 : Early recdev biasadj is >2 times ratio of rmse to sigmaR
Warning 7 : Final gradient: 0.000271039 is larger than final_conv: 1e-05
