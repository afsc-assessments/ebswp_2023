1 NOTE: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
2 Minimum pop size bin:_10; is > L at Amin for sex: 1; Gpat: 1; L= 5
3  Early recdev biasadj is >2 times ratio of rmse to sigmaR
4 Final gradient: 0.000195071 is larger than final_conv: 1e-05
