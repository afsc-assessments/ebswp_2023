# EBS Pollock Model Description

## Dynamics

This assessment is based on a statistical age-structured model with the catch equation and population
dynamics model as described in Fournier and Archibald (1982) and elsewhere
(e.g., Hilborn and Walters 1992, Schnute and Richards 1995, McAllister and Ianelli
1997). The catch in numbers at age in year $t (C_{t,a})$ and total catch biomass $(Y_t)$
can be described as:

\begin{align}
    C_{t,a}     &= \frac{F_{t,a}}{Z_{t,a}} \left(1 - e^{-Z_{t,a}}\right) N_{t,a}, &1 \le t \le T, 1 \le a \le A \\
    N_{t+1,a+1} &= N_{t,a-1} e^{-Z_{t,a-1}}                                       &1 \le t \le T, 1 \le a < A   \\
    N_{t+1,A}   &= N_{t,A-1} e^{-Z_{t,A-1}} + N_{t,A} e^{-Z_{t,A}} ,              &1 \le t \le T                \\
    Z_{t,a}     &= F_{t,a} + M_{t,a}                                                                            \\
    C_{t,.}     &= \sum_{a=1}^A{C_{t,a}}                                                                        \\
    p_{t,a}     &= \frac{C_{t,a} } {C_{t,.} }                                                                   \\
    Y_{t}       &= \sum_{a=1}^A{w_{t,a}C_{t,a}}                                                                 \\
\end{align}

where
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$T$       & is the number of years, \\
$A$       & is the number of age classes in the population, \\
$N_{t,a}$ & is the number of fish age $a$ in year $t$, \\
$C_{t,a}$ & is the catch of age class $a$ in year $t$, \\
$p_{t,a}$ & is the proportion of the total catch in year $t$, that is in age class $a$, \\
$C_{t}$   & is the total catch in year $t$, \\
$w_{a}$   & is the mean body weight (kg) of fish in age class $a$, \\
$Y_{t}$   & is the total yield biomass in year $t$, \\
$F_{t,a}$ & is the instantaneous fishing mortality for age class $a$, in year $t$, \\
$M_{t,a}$ & is the instantaneous natural mortality in year $t$ for age class $a$, and \\
$Z_{t,a}$ & is the instantaneous total mortality for age class $a$, in year $t$. 
\end{tabular}

Fishing mortality ($F_{t,a}$) is specified as being semi-separable and non-parametric in form
with restrictions on the variability following Butterworth et al. (2003):

\begin{align}
    F_{t,a}     &= s_{t,a} \, \mu^f e^{\epsilon_t}, &\epsilon_t   \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,\sigma_E^{2}) \\
    s_{t+1,a}   &= s_{t,a} \,       e^{\gamma_t},   &\gamma_t     \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,\sigma_s^{2}) 
\end{align}

where $s_{t,a}$ is the selectivity for age class $a$ in year $t$, and $\mu^f$
is the median fishing mortality rate over time.

If the selectivities ($s_{t,a}$) are constant over time then fishing mortality
rate decomposes into an age component and a year component.  A curvature
penalty on the selectivity coefficients using the squared second-differences
to provide smoothness between ages.

Bottom-trawl survey selectivity was set to be asymptotic yet retain the
properties desired for the characteristics of this gear. Namely, that the
function should allow flexibility in selecting age 1 pollock over time. The
functional form of this selectivity was:

\begin{align}
    s_{t,a}     &= \left[ 1+e^{-\alpha_ta-\beta_t} \right]^{-1} , & a>1 \\
    s_{t,a}     &= \mu_se^{-\delta^\mu_t},                        & a=1 \\
    \alpha_{t}  &= \bar \alpha e^{\delta^\alpha_t},                     \\
    \beta_{t}  &= \bar \beta e^{\delta^\beta_t},                        
\end{align}

where the parameters of the selectivity function follow a random
walk process as in Dorn et al. (2000):

\begin{align}
    \delta_t^\mu  -  \delta_{t+1}^\mu     &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,\sigma_{\delta^\mu}^{2}) \\
    \\
    \alpha_t^\mu  -  \alpha_{t+1}^\mu     &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,\sigma_{\alpha^\mu}^{2}) \\
    \beta_t^\mu  -  \beta_{t+1}^\mu     &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,\sigma_{\beta^\mu}^{2}) 
\end{align}

The parameters to be estimated in this part of the model are thus for t=1982 through to `r thisyr`. 
The variance terms for these process error parameters were specified to be 0.04.

In this assessment, the random-walk deviation penalty was optionally shifted
to the changes in log-selectivity. that is, for the BTS estimates, the process
error was applied to the logistic parameters as above, but the  lognormal
penalty was applied to the resulting selectivities-at-age directly. The extent
of this variability was evaluated in the context of the impact on age-specific
survey catchability/availability and contrasted with an independent estimate of 
pollock availability to the bottom trawl survey. 
\begin{align}
    {ln(s_{t,a})}  -  {ln(s_{t+1,a})}  &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,\sigma_{sel}^{2}) \\
\end{align}
In 2008 the AT survey selectivity approach was modified. As an option, the age
one pollock observed in this trawl can be treated as an index and are not
considered part of the age composition (which then ranges from age 2-15). This
was done to improve some interaction with the flexible selectivity smoother
that is used for this gear and was compared. Additionally, the annual
specification of input observation variance terms was allowed for the AT data.


A diagnostic approach to evaluate input variance specifications (via sample
size under multinomial assumptions) was added in the 2018 assessment. This method
uses residuals from mean ages together with the concept that the sample
variance of mean age (from a given annual data set) varies inversely with
input sample size. It can be shown that for a given set of input proportions
at age (up to the maximum age $A$)  and sample size $N_t$ for year $t$, an adjustment
factor $\nu$ for input sample size can be computed when compared with the
assessment model predicted proportions at age ($\hat p_{ta}$) and model predicted mean age
($\hat{\bar{a_t}}$):
\begin{align}
\nu   &= \text{var}\left( r^a_t \sqrt{\frac{N_t}{\kappa_t} }\right)^{-1} \\
r^a_t &= \bar a_t - \hat{\bar{a_t}}                                      \\
\kappa_t &= \left[ \sum_a^A {\bar a_t - \hat{\bar{a_t}}} \right]^{0.5}
\end{align}

where $r^a_t$ is the residual of mean age and
\begin{align}
\hat{\bar{a_t}} &= \sum_a^A{a \hat p_{ta}}\, \\
{\bar a_t}      &= \sum_a^A{a p_{ta}}\, 
\end{align}

Based on previous analyses, we used the above relationship as a diagnostic for
evaluating input sample sizes by comparing model predicted mean ages with
observed mean ages and the implied 95% confidence bands. This method provided
support for modifying the frequency of allowing selectivity changes.
 
## Recruitment

In these analyses, recruitment ($R_t$) represents numbers of age-1 individuals
modeled as a stochastic  function of spawning stock biomass. 
\begin{align}
        R_t = f\left(B_{t-1} \right)
\end{align}
with mature spawning biomass during year $t$ was defined as:
\begin{align}
  B_t = \sum_{a=1}^A{ w_{t,a}\phi_aN_{t,a}} 
\end{align}

and, $\phi_a$ is the proportion of mature females at age is as shown in the sub-section
titled Natural mortality and maturity at age under "Parameters estimated
independently" above.

A reparameterized form for the stock-recruitment relationship following
Francis (1992) was used. For the optional Beverton-Holt form (the Ricker form
presented in Eq. 12 was adopted for this assessment) we have:
\begin{align}
R_t &= \frac{B_{t-1}e^{\varepsilon_t} }{\alpha+\beta B_{t-1} }
\end{align}

where 
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$R_t$       & is recruitment at age 1 in year $t$, \\
$B_t$       & is the biomass of mature spawning females in year $t$, \\
$\varepsilon_t$ & is  the recruitment anomaly for year $t$, ($\varepsilon_t   \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,\sigma_R^{2}$ ) \\
$\alpha,\,\beta$    & are stock recruitment parameters. 
\end{tabular}

Values for the stock-recruitment function parameters  and  are calculated from
the values of  (the number of 0-year-olds in the absence of exploitation and
recruitment variability) and the steepness of the stock-recruit relationship
($h$). The steepness is the fraction of R0 to be expected (in the absence of
recruitment variability) when the mature biomass is reduced to 20% of its
pristine level (Francis 1992), so that:

\begin{align}
 \alpha &= \tilde B_0 \frac{1-h}{4h} \\
 \beta &= \frac{5h-1}{4hR_0 } 
\end{align}

where $\tilde B_0$ is the total egg production (or proxy, e.g., female
spawning biomass) in the absence of exploitation (and recruitment
variability) expressed as a fraction of $R_0$.

Some interpretation and further explanation follows. For steepness equal 0.2,
then recruits are a linear function of spawning biomass (implying no surplus
production). For steepness equal to 1.0, then recruitment is constant for all
levels of spawning stock size. A value of $h = 0.9$ implies that at 20% of the
unfished spawning stock size will result in an expected value of 90% unfished
recruitment level. Steepness of 0.7 is a commonly assumed default value for
the Beverton-Holt form (e.g., Kimura 1988). The prior distribution for
steepness used a beta distribution as in Ianelli et al. (2016). 
The prior on steepness was specified to be a symmetric form of the
Beta distribution with $\alpha = \beta = 14.93$ implying a prior mean of 0.5 and CV of
12% (implying that there is about a 14% chance that the steepness is greater
than 0.6). This conservative prior is consistent with previous yearsâ€™
application and serves to constrain the stock-recruitment curve from favoring
steep slopes (uninformative priors result in $F_{MSY}$ values near an $F_{SPR}$ of about
$F_{18\%}$ a value considerably higher than the default proxy of $F_{35\%}$). The
residual pattern for the post-1977 recruits used in fitting the curve with a
more diffuse prior resulted in all estimated recruits being below the curve
for stock sizes less than $B_{MSY}$ (except for the 1978 year class). We believe
this to be driven primarily by the apparent negative-slope for recruits
relative to stock sizes above $B_{MSY}$ and as such, provides a potentially
unrealistic estimate of productivity at low stock sizes. This prior was
elicited from the rationale that residuals should be reasonably balanced
throughout the range of spawning stock sizes. Whereas this is somewhat
circular (i.e., using data for prior elicitation), the point here is that
residual patterns (typically ignored in these types of models) were 
qualitatively considered. 

In model 16.1 (from the 2019 assessment), a Beverton Holt stock recruitment form was implemented
using the prior value of 0.67 for steepness and a CV of 0.17. This resulted in 
beta distribution parameters (for the prior) at $\alpha = 6.339$ and  
$\beta = 4.293$.

The value of $\sigma_R$ was set at 1.0 to
accommodate additional uncertainty in factors affecting recruitment
variability.

To have the critical value for the stock-recruitment function (steepness, _h_)
on the same scale for the Ricker model, we begin with the parameterization of
Kimura (1990):
\begin{align}
R_t &= \frac{B_{t-1}e^{\alpha \left(1-B_{t-1} \frac{R_0}{\psi_0} \right)}}{\psi_0}
\end{align}

It can be shown that the Ricker parameter a maps to steepness as:
\begin{align}
h &= \frac{e^\alpha}{e^\alpha+4}
\end{align}

so that the prior used on _h_ can be implemented in both the Ricker and
Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment forms. Here the term $\psi_0$ represents the equilibrium
unfished spawning biomass per-recruit.

## Diagnostics

In 2006 a replay feature was added where the time series of recruitment
estimates from a particular model is used to compute the subsequent abundance
expectation had no fishing occurred. These recruitments are adjusted from the
original estimates by the ratio of the expected recruitment given spawning
biomass (with and without fishing) and the estimated stock-recruitment curve.
I.e., the recruitment under no fishing is modified as:
$$R_t' = \hat{R}_t\frac{f(B_{t-1}')}{f(B_{t-1})}$$
where $R_t$ is the original recruitment estimate in year $t$ with $B_{t-1}'$ and $B_{t-1}$ representing
the stock-recruitment function given spawning biomass under no fishing and
under the estimated fishing intensity, respectively.

The assessment model code allows retrospective analyses (e.g., Parma 1993, and
Ianelli and Fournier 1998). This was designed to assist in specifying how
spawning biomass patterns (and uncertainty) have changed due to new data. The
retrospective approach simply uses the current model to evaluate how it may
change over time with the addition of new data based on the evolution of data
collected over the past several years.

## Parameter estimation

The objective function was simply the sum of the negative log-likelihood
function and logs of the prior distributions. To fit large numbers of
parameters in nonlinear models it is useful to be able to estimate certain
parameters in different stages. The ability to estimate stages is also
important in using robust likelihood functions since it is often undesirable
to use robust objective functions when models are far from a solution.
Consequently, in the early stages of estimation we use the following log-
likelihood function for the survey and fishery catch at age data (in numbers):

\begin{align}
nll(i) &= n \sum_{t,a}{ p_{ta} \ln \hat p_{ta} } \\
p_{ta} &= \frac{O_{ta}}{\sum_a{O_{ta}}} \hspace{20pt} 
\hat p_{ta} = \frac{\hat C_{ta}}{\sum_a{\hat C_{ta}}} \\
\mathbf{C} &= \mathbf{CE}  \\
\mathbf{E}  &=  \begin{array}{llll} 
b_{1,1} & b_{1,2} & \dots & b_{1,15} \\
b_{2,1} & b_{2,2} &       & b_{2,15} \\
\vdots &         & \ddots &  \vdots \\
b_{15,1} & b_{15,2} & \dots      & b_{15,15} 
\end{array}  
\end{align}

where $A$, and $T$, represent the number of age classes and years, respectively, n
is the sample size, and  represent the observed and predicted numbers at age
in the catch. The elements bi,j represent ageing mis-classification
proportions are based on independent agreement rates between otolith age
readers. For the models presented this year, the option for including aging
errors was re-evaluated.

Sample size values were revised and are shown in the main document. Strictly
speaking, the amount of data collected for this fishery indicates higher
values might be warranted. However, the standard multinomial sampling process
is not robust to violations of assumptions (Fournier et al. 1990).
Consequently, as the model fit approached a solution, we invoke a robust
likelihood function which fit proportions at age as:

\begin{align}
\prod_{a=1}^A\prod_{t=1}^T \left[\left( \exp{\left(-\frac{\left(p_{ta}-\hat p_{ta}\right)^2}{2\left(\eta_{ta}+0.1/A\right)\tau_t^2} \right)
}+0.01 \right) \times  \frac{1}{ {\sqrt{2\pi \left ( \eta_{ta}+0.1/A \right) \tau_t}} } \right]
\end{align}

Taking the logarithm we obtain the log-likelihood function for the age composition data:

\begin{align}
nll(i) = -0.5\sum_{a=1}^A\sum_{t=1}^T{
{\ln{2\pi \left( \eta_{ta}+0.1/A \right) 
-\sum_t^T A\ln\tau_t}} } 
+\sum_{a=1}^A\sum_{t=1}^T{\ln\left\{
\exp{\left(-\frac{\left(p_{ta}-\hat p_{ta}\right)^2}{\left(2\eta_{ta}+0.1/A\right)\tau_t^2} \right)
+ 0.01 } 
\right\}}
\end{align}

where 
\begin{align}
\eta_{ta} &=  p_{ta}(1-p_{ta})\\ 
\text{and} \\
\tau_t^2 &=  1/n_t 
\end{align}
which gives the variance for  $p_{ta}$
\begin{align}
(\eta_{ta}+0.1/A)\tau_t^2
\end{align}

Completing the estimation in this fashion reduces the model sensitivity to
data that would otherwise be considered outliers.

Within the model, predicted survey abundance accounted for within-year
mortality since surveys occur during the middle of the year. As in previous
years, we assumed that removals by the survey were insignificant (i.e., the
mortality of pollock caused by the survey was considered insignificant).
Consequently, a set of analogous catchability and selectivity terms were
estimated for fitting the survey observations as:

\begin{align}
\hat N_{ta}^s &= e^{-0.5Z_{ta}}N_{ta}q_t^ss_{ta}^S
\end{align}

where the superscript s indexes the type of survey (AT or BTS). For the option
to use the survey predictions in biomass terms instead of just abundance, the
above was modified to include observed survey biomass weights-at-age:

\begin{align}
\hat N_{ta}^s &= e^{-0.5Z_{ta}}w_{ta}N_{ta}q_t^ss_{ta}^S
\end{align}

For the AVO index, the values for selectivity were assumed to be the same as
for the AT survey and the mean weights at age over time was also assumed to be
equal to the values estimated for the AT survey.

For these analyses we chose to keep survey catchabilities constant over time
(though they are estimated separately for the AVO index and for the AT and
bottom trawl surveys). The contribution to the negative log-likelihood
function (ignoring constants) from the surveys is given by either the
lognormal distribution:

\begin{align}
nll(i) &= \sum_t{\frac{\ln(u_t^s/\hat N_t^s)^2}{2\sigma_{s,t}^2}}
\end{align}
where $u_t^s$ is the total (numerical abundance or optionally biomass) estimate with variance $\sigma_{s,t}$ from survey $s$ in year $t$ or optionally, the normal distribution can be selected:
\begin{align}
nll(i) &= \sum_t{\frac{(u_t^s - \hat N_t^s)^2}{2\sigma_{s,t}^2}}. \\
\end{align}


The AT survey and AVO index is modeled using a lognormal distribution whereas
for the BTS survey, a normal distribution was applied.     

For model configurations in which the BTS data are corrected for estimated
efficiency, a multivariate lognormal distribution was used. For the negative-
log likelihood component this was modeled as
\begin{equation}
nll_i = 0.5\mathbf{X}\Sigma^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{'}
\end{equation}

where is a vector of observed minus model predicted values for this index and
$\Sigma$ is the estimated covariance matrix provided from the method provided in
Kotwicki et al. 2014. For the VAST estimates, the supplied covariance matrix was 
used in the same way.

The contribution to the negative log-likelihood function for the observed total catch biomass 
($C_b^{obs}, \hat{C_b}$) by the fishery is given by
\begin{equation}
nll_i = 0.5\sum_t\frac{\ln(C_b^{obs}/\hat C_b)^2}{2\sigma_{C_b,t}^2}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{C_b,t}$ is pre-specified (set to 0.05) reflecting the accuracy of the
overall observed catch in biomass. Similarly, the contribution of prior
distributions (in negative log-density) to the log-likelihood function include
$\lambda_\varepsilon \sum_t\varepsilon_t^2 +\lambda_\gamma \sum_{ta}\gamma^2 +  \lambda_\delta \sum_t\delta_t^2$
where the size of the â€™s represent prior assumptions about the variances of
these random variables. Most of these parameters are associated with year-to-
year and age specific deviations in selectivity coefficients. For a
presentation of this type of Bayesian approach to modeling errors-in-
variables, the reader is referred to Schnute (1994). To facilitate estimating
such a large number of parameters, automatic differentiation software extended
from Greiwank and Corliss (1991) and developed into C++ class libraries was
used. This software provided the derivative calculations needed for finding
the posterior mode via a quasi-Newton function minimization routine (e.g.,
Press et al. 1992). The model implementation language (ADModel Builder) gave
simple and rapid access to these routines and provided the ability estimate
the variance-covariance matrix for all dependent and independent parameters of
interest.

## Uncertainty in mean body mass
The approach we use to solve for $F_{MSY}$ and related quantities (e.g., $B_{MSY}$ $MSY$)
within a general integrated model context was shown in Ianelli et al. (2001).
In 2007 this was modified to include uncertainty in weight-at-age as an
explicit part of the uncertainty for $F_{MSY}$ calculations. This involved
estimating a vector of parameters ($w_{ta}^{future}$) on current (`r thisyr`) and future mean weights
for each age $i$,  $i$= (1, 2,â€¦,15), given actual observed mean and variances in
weight-at-age over the period 1991-`r thisyr-1`. The values of based on available data
and (if this option is selected) estimates the parameters subject to the
natural constraint:
    $$w_{ta}^{future} \sim \mathcal{N}(\bar{w_{a}},\,\sigma_{w_a}^{2})$$ 
Note that this converges to the mean values over the time series of data (no
other likelihood component within the model is affected by future mean
weights-at-age) while retaining the natural uncertainty that can propagate
through estimates of $F_{MSY}$ uncertainty. This latter point is essentially a
requirement of the Tier 1 categorization.

Subsequently, this method was refined to account for current-year survey data and both 
cohort and year effects.  The model for this is:
\begin{align}
\hat{w}_{ta} &= \bar w_a e^{\upsilon_t} & a=1, \, t \ge 1964 \\
\hat{w}_{ta} &= \hat{w}_{t-1,a-1} + \Delta_a e^{\psi_t} & a > 1, \, t > 1964 \\
\Delta_a     &= \bar w_{a+1} - \bar w_a & a<A  \\
\bar w_a     &= \alpha \left\{L_1+ \left(L_2-L_1\right)\left(\frac{1-K^{a-1}}{1-K^{A-1}}\right)\right\}^3  \\
\end{align}
where the fixed effects parameters are $L_1, L_2, K,$ and $\alpha$ while the random effects parameters 
are $\upsilon_t$ and $\psi_t$. 

## Tier 1 projections

Tier 1 projections were calculated two ways. First, for `r nextyr` and `r nextyr+1` ABC and
$OFL$ levels, the harmonic mean $F_{MSY}$ value was computed and the analogous
harvest rate ($\bar{u_{HM}}$) applied to the estimated geometric mean fishable biomass at
$B_{MSY}$ :
\begin{align}
ABC_t &= B_{GM,t}^f \hat{u}_{HM}\zeta_t \\
B_{GM,t}^f &= e^{\ln{\hat{B}_t^f}-0.5\sigma_{B^f}^2} \\
u_{HM,t}^f &= e^{\ln{\hat{u}_{MSY,t}}-0.5\sigma_{u_{MSY}}^2} \\
\zeta_{t} &= \frac{B_t/B_{MSY}-0.05}{1-0.05} & B_t < B_{MSY} \\
\zeta_{t} &= 1.0 & B_t \ge  B_{MSY} 
\end{align}

where $\hat{B}_t^f$ is the point estimate of the fishable biomass defined (for
a given year): $\sum_a{N_as_{ta}w_{ta}}$ with $N_{ta}$, $s_{ta}$, and $w_{ta}$ the estimated population numbers
(begin year), selectivity and weights-at-age, respectively. $B_{MSY}$ and $B_{t}$ are
the point estimates spawning biomass levels at equilibrium $F_{MSY}$ and in year $t$
(at time of spawning). For these projections, catch must be specified (or
solved for if in the current year when $B_t < B_{MSY}$). For longer term projections
a form of operating model (as has been presented for the evaluation of $B_{20\%}$)
with feedback (via future catch specifications) using the control rule and
assessment model would be required.
