    abstract = { The spatial distributions of marine fish populations are influenced by environmental conditions, intrinsic properties of the populations, and prior distribution. The influence of these factors may not be consistent across age classes. For this study, age composition estimates for walleye pollock collected on bottom-trawl surveys in the Bering Sea were used to estimate range correlation indices, population centers of gravity, and effective area occupied. Age-specific density maps suggest a circular ontogenic migration during the summer feeding season, with the youngest and oldest groups most broadly distributed. Range correlation analysis among age groups and year classes provides evidence of a population cohort effect in the spatial distribution of the population. Variance decomposition analysis indicates that the spatial distribution of age groups during summer is influenced by the initial distribution of that cohort as recruits. Model-based analyses show that extrinsic temperature variables affect the youngest and oldest age classes the most, but provide no indication of age-related effects for intrinsic population factors. This study shows that both cohort and age-specific factors are important drivers of spatial distribution. }

    abstract = { The temperature-size rule predicts that climate warming will lead to faster growth rates for juvenile fishes but lower adult body size. Testing this prediction is central to understanding the effects of climate change on population dynamics. We use fisheries-independent data (1999-2019) to test predictions of age-specific climate effects on body size in eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus). This stock supports one of the largest food fisheries in the world but is experiencing exceptionally rapid warming. Our results support the predictions that weight-at-age increases with temperature for young age classes (ages 1, 3-4) but decreases with temperature for old age classes (ages 7-15). Simultaneous demonstrations of larger juveniles and smaller adults with warming have thus far been rare, but pollock provide a striking example in a fish of exceptional ecological and commercial importance. The age-specific response to temperature was large enough (0.5 – 1 SD change in log weight-at-age) to have important implications for pollock management, which must estimate current and future weight-at-age to calculate allowable catch, and for the Bering Sea pollock fishery. }

abstract = {Although highly variable in time and space, predation remains the greatest source of mortality for juvenile and lower trophic-level fishes. As such, predation can have substantial and long-term effects on the dynamics of these prey. Gulf of Alaska walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) has shown considerable variability in biomass over the past four decades. During this same time, the demersal fish community transitioned from being dominated by pollock to a system comprised primarily of upper trophic-level predators. We estimated time-varying predation mortality to better understand its effects on the population dynamics of pollock in this currently “top heavy” system. Our index of predation accounted for spatiotemporal variation in predator biomass, bioenergetics-based rations, and age-specific proportions of pollock consumed (1990–2019). To evaluate population-level impacts of predation, we included an index of removals as part of the stock assessment model. This formulation allowed for non-annual data inputs and included a proportionality constant with which to scale predation. Age-specific natural mortality was allowed to vary according to a penalized random walk. We found that natural mortality ranged from 37% higher to 17% lower than the long-term mean. Resulting estimates of total pollock biomass differed by as much as 37% relative to a model without time-varying natural mortality, though the maximum difference for exploitable biomass was only 14%. Using an empirically-derived predation index to modify constant natural mortality allows stock assessment scientists to evaluate impacts of time-varying predation on assessed species. This approach provides a relatively simple way of incorporating ecological information into single-species stock assessments and may reduce bias compared to conventional models that do not account for changes in predation mortality. Notably, including predation mortality in single-species assessments may help identify inconsistencies in biomass estimates that warrant further consideration.}
