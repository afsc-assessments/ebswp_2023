# Appendix on model-based methods on bottom-trawl survey biomass trends {#sec-vast}

## Overview

These applications of `VAST` were configured to model 
NMFS/AFSC bottom trawl survey (BTS) data and for acoustic backscatter data (next section).
For the BTS, the station-specific CPUEs
(kg per hectare) for pollock were compiled from 1982-2023. Further details can
be found at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/james- thorson/VAST/#description) 
mainpage, wiki, and glossary.  The R help files,
e.g., `?make_data` for explanation of data inputs, or `?make_settings` for
explanation of settings. 

The software versions of dependent programs used to generate VAST estimates were:   

* R (4.3.0)
* MKL libraries via Microsoft R Open (4.0.2)
* INLA (21.11.22)
* Matrix (1.4-0)
* TMB (1.9.6)
* TMBhelper (1.4.0) 
* VAST (3.10.1)
* FishStatsUtils (2.12.1) 

For these model-based index time series, we used the same VAST model run settings.

## Spatio-temporal treatment of survey data on pollock density

For EBS pollock we used data on biomass per unit area from all grid cells and corner stations in the 83-112 bottom trawl survey of the EBS, 1982-2023, including exploratory northern extension samples in 2001, 2005, and 2006, as well as 83-112 samples available in the NBS in 1982, 1985, 1988, 1991, 2010, and 2017-2023 (except 2020). NBS samples collected prior to 2010 and in 2018 did not follow the 20 nautical mile sampling grid used in 2010, 2017, 2019, 2021, and 20232019, 2021–2023 surveys. Assimilating these data therefore required extrapolating into unsampled areas. As before, we included a a spatially varying covariate of the cold-pool extent (Thorson 2019, (O’Leary et al. 2020). All environmental data used as covariates were computed within the R package coldpool (Rohan et al., 2022).

We used a Poisson-link delta-model (Thorson 2018) involving two linear predictors and a gamma
distribution to model positive catch rates. We extrapolated population density to the entire EBS
and NBS in each year, using extrapolation grids that are available within [FishStatsUtils] (https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/FishStatsUtils). These extrapolation grids were defined using
3705 m (2 nmi) × 3705 m (2 nmi) cells; this results in 36,690 extrapolation-grid cells for the
eastern Bering Sea and 15,079 in the northern Bering Sea. We used bilinear interpolation to
interpolate densities from 750 “knots” to these extrapolation grid cells; knots were approximately
evenly distributed over space, in proportion to the dimensions of the extrapolation grid. We
estimated geometric anisotropy (how spatial autocorrelation declines with differing rates over
distance in some cardinal directions than others), and included a spatial and spatio-temporal term
for both linear predictors. To facilitate interpolation of density between unsampled years, we
specified that the spatio-temporal fields were structured over time as an AR(1) process (where the
magnitude of autocorrelation was estimated as a fixed effect for each linear predictor). However,
we did not include any temporal correlation for intercepts, which we treated as fixed effects for
each linear predictor and year. Finally, we used epsilon bias-correction to correct for
retransformation bias (Thorson and Kristensen 2016). 

We checked model fits for evidence of non-convergence by confirming that (1) the derivative of the
marginal likelihood with respect to each fixed effect was sufficiently small (less than ~0.001)
and (2) that the
Hessian matrix was positive definite.  We then checked for evidence of model fit by computing
Dunn-Smyth randomized quantile residuals (Dunn and Smyth 1996) and visualizing these using a
quantile-quantile plot within the DHARMa R package.  We also evaluated the distribution of these
residuals over space in each year, and inspected them for evidence of residual spatio-temporal
patterns.  

## Spatio-temporal treatment of survey age composition data

For model-based estimation of age
   compositions in the Bering Sea, we fitted observations of numerical abundance-at-age at each
   sampling location. This was made possible by applying a year-specific, region-specific (EBS and
   NBS) age-length key to records of numerical abundance and length-composition. We computed these
   estimates in VAST, assuming a Poisson-link delta-model (Thorson 2018) involving two linear
   predictors, and a gamma distribution to model positive catch rates. We did not include any
   density covariates in estimation of age composition for consistency with models used in the
   previous assessment, and due to computational limitations. We used the same extrapolation grid
   as implemented for abundance indices, but here we modeled spatial and spatiotemporal fields with
   a mesh with coarser spatial resolution than the index model, here using 50 “knots”. This
   reduction in the spatial resolution of the model, relative to that used abundance indices, was
   necessary due to the increased computational load of fitting multiple age categories and using
   epsilon bias-correction. We implemented the same diagnostics to check convergence and model fit
   as those used for abundance indices.

## Diagnostic plots from BTS work
### Encounter-probability component
One can check to ensure that observed encounter frequencies for either low or high
probability samples are within the 95% predictive interval for predicted
encounter probability (Fig. \ref{fig:encounter}. 
Diagnostics for positive-catch-rate component were evaluated using a standard Q-Q plot. 
Qualitatively, the fits to pollock data are reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:eq1} and \ref{fig:qq2}).

### Pearson residuals
Spatially the residual pattern can be evaluated over time. Results for pollock data shows that consistent positive or negative 
residuals accross or within years is limited for the encounter probability component of the model and 
for the positive catch rate component (Figures \ref{fig:pearson1} and \ref{fig:pearson2}, respectively).

### Densities and biomass estimates

Relative densities over time suggests that the biomass of pollock can reflect
abundances in the NBS even in years where samples are unavailable (all years
except 2010, 2017--2019 and 2021--2023; (\cref{fig:density}). Index values and error terms
(based on diagonal of covariance matrix over time) are shown in @fig-vast_idx.
