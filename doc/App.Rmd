# Appendix on spatio-temporal analysis of NMFS survey data

## Overview

These applications of `VAST` were configured to model 
NMFS/AFSC bottom trawl survey (BTS) data and for acoustic backscatter data (next section).
For the BTS, the station-specific CPUEs
(kg per hectare) for pollock were compiled from 1982-2019. Further details can
be found at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/james- thorson/VAST/#description) 
mainpage, wiki, and glossary.  The R help files,
e.g., `?make_data` for explanation of data inputs, or `?make_settings` for
explanation of settings. VAST has involved many publications for developing
individual features (see references section below). What follows is intended
as a step by step documentation of applying the model to these data.

The software versions of dependent programs used to generate VAST estimates were:   

  - Microsoft Open R (4.0.2)    
  - INLA (21.2.23)    
  - TMB (1.7.20)    
  - TMBhelper (1.3.0)    
  - VAST (3.6.1)    
  - FishStatsUtils (2.8.0)    
    
For the model-based index time series, we used the same VAST model run (and associated results)
as the 2019 SAFE. We include additional details regarding model settings here, as requested
during the December 2019 SSC meeting.

## Spatio-temporal treatment of survey data on pollock density

We fitted records of biomass per unit area from all grid cells and corner stations in the 83-112 
bottom trawl survey of the EBS, 1982-2019, and 2021, as well as 83-112 samples available in the NBS in 
1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 2001, 2005, 2006, 2010, 2017-2019, and 2021. 
NBS samples prior to 2010 did not follow the 30 
nautical mile sampling grid that was used in 2010, 2017, 2019 and 2021, and the 2018 sampling followed 
a coarsened grid as well. Assimilating these data therefore required extrapolating into unsampled areas.
This extrapolation was assisted by including a spatially varying response to cold-pool extent (Thorson, 2019). 
This spatially varying response was estimated for both linear predictors of the delta-model, and detailed 
comparison of results for EBS pollock has showed that it has a small but notable effect (O’Leary et al., 2020). 
For example, the NBS was not sampled between 2010 and 2017, and the cold-pool extent started to decrease 
substantially around 2014; therefore, including this covariate results in estimates that depart somewhat 
from a “Brownian bridge” between 2010 and 2017, and instead suggests that densities in the NBS increased 
progressively after 2014 when cold-pool-extent declined prior to 2017. 

Specifically, we used a Poisson-link delta-model (Thorson, 2018) involving two linear predictors, 
and a gamma distribution for the distribution of positive catch rates. We extrapolated density to 
the entire EBS and NBS in each year, using extrapolation-grids that are available within _FishStatsUtils_ 
are used when integrating densities. These extrapolation-grids are defined using 3705 m 
(2 nmi) X 3705 m (2 nmi) cells;  this results in 36,690 extrapolation-grid cells for the 
eastern Bering Sea and 15,079 in the northern Bering Sea.  We used bilinear interpolation 
to interpolate densities from 750 “knots” to these extrapolation-grid cells; knots were 
distributed spatially in proportion to the distribution of extrapolation-grid cells (i.e., 
having an approximately even distribution across space).  We estimated “geometric anisotropy” 
(the tendency for correlations to decline faster in some cardinal directions than others), and 
including a spatial and spatio-temporal term for both linear predictors.  To improve interpolation 
of density “hotspots” between unsampled years, we specified that the spatio-temporal term was 
autocorrelated across years (where the magnitude of autocorrelation was estimated as a fixed 
effect for each linear predictor).  However, we did not include any temporal correlation for 
intercepts, which we treated as fixed effects for each linear predictor and year.  Finally, 
we used epsilon bias-correction to correct for retransformation bias (Thorson and Kristensen, 2016).  

We checked model fits for evidence of non-convergence by confirming that (1) the derivative of the marginal 
likelihood with respect to each fixed effect was sufficiently small and (2) that the Hessian matrix 
was positive definite.  We then checked for evidence of model fit by computing Dunn-Smyth randomized 
quantile residuals (Dunn and Smyth 1996) and visualizing these using a quantile-quantile plot within the DHARMa R package.  
We also evaluated the distribution of these residuals over space in each year, and inspected them for evidence of residual 
spatio-temporal patterns.  


## Spatio-temporal treatment of survey age composition data
To date, assessments using spatio-temporal indices have kept age-composition data unchanged 
(i.e., the estimates were based on the original design-based approach). In 2019 we developed a spatio-temporal 
approach to obtain age composition estimates (O'leary et al. 2020).  The comparison with design-based age 
composition estimates was similar to the model-based estimates. For this year, we began to expand this
work to cover the NBS but the age data for this region are incomplete. Consequently we used the design-based 
estimates as in prior years (including staton-specific density-dependent corrections).

## Diagnostic plots from BTS work
### Encounter-probability component
One can check to ensure that observed encounter frequencies for either low or high
probability samples are within the 95% predictive interval for predicted
encounter probability (Fig. \ref{fig:encounter}. 
Diagnostics for positive-catch-rate component were evaluated using a standard Q-Q plot. 
Qualitatively, the fits to pollock data are reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:eq1} and \ref{fig:qq2}).

### Pearson residuals
Spatially the residual pattern can be evaluated over time. Results for pollock data shows that consistent positive or negative 
residuals accross or within years is limited for the encounter probability component of the model and 
for the positive catch rate component (Figures \ref{fig:pearson1} and \ref{fig:pearson2}, respectively).

### Densities and biomass estimates

Relative densities over time suggests that the biomass of pollock can reflect
abundances in the NBS even in years where samples are unavailable (all years
except 2010, 2017--2019 and 2021; (Fig. \ref{fig:density}). Index values and error terms
(based on diagonal of covariance matrix over time) are shown in Figure \ref{fig:vast_idx}


## Extending VAST to create estimates from acoustic backscatter data

In 2020 we presented an initial spatio-temporal model to the acoustic backscatter data
collected to half meter from the seafloor from RV Oscar Dyson
(1994-2018) and the USV in 2020 following the same extrapolation area as for the BTS analyses.
We anticipate updating this for application as an alternative to the standard acoustic survey
in 2022.
