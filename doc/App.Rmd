# Appendix on spatio-temporal analysis of NMFS survey data

## Overview

These applications of `VAST` were configured to model 
NMFS/AFSC bottom trawl survey (BTS) data and for acoustic backscatter data (next section).
For the BTS, the station-specific CPUEs
(kg per hectare) for pollock were compiled from 1982-2019. Further details can
be found at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/james- thorson/VAST/#description) 
mainpage, wiki, and glossary.  The R help files,
e.g., `?make_data` for explanation of data inputs, or `?make_settings` for
explanation of settings. VAST has involved many publications for developing
individual features (see references section below). What follows is intended
as a step by step documentation of applying the model to these data.

The software versions of dependent programs used to generate VAST estimates were:   
  - Microsoft R Open (4.0.2)
  - INLA (21.11.22)
  - TMB (1.9.0)
  - TMBhelper (1.4.0) 
  - VAST (3.9.0)
  - FishStatsUtils (2.11.0) 

For the model-based index time series, we used the same VAST model run (and associated results)
as the 2019 SAFE. We include additional details regarding model settings here, as requested
during the December 2019 SSC meeting.

## Spatio-temporal treatment of survey data on pollock density

For model-based indices in the Bering Sea, we fitted observations of numerical abundance or biomass
per unit area (where the use of abundance or biomass varied by stock at the request of assessors)
from all grid cells and corner stations in the 83-112 bottom trawl survey of the EBS, 1982-2022,
including exploratory northern extension samples in 2001, 2005, and 2006, as well as 83-112 samples
available in the NBS in 1982, 1985, 1988, 1991, 2010, and 2017-2021. NBS samples collected prior to
2010 and in 2018 did not follow the 20 nautical mile sampling grid that was used in 2010, 2017,
2019, 2021 and 2022 surveys. Assimilating these data therefore required extrapolating into
unsampled areas. This extrapolation was facilitated by including a spatially varying response to
cold-pool extent (Thorson 2019). This spatially varying response was estimated for both linear
predictors of the delta-model, and detailed comparison of results for EBS pollock has shown that it
has a small but notable effect on these indices and resulting stock assessment outputs (O’Leary et
al. 2020). For example, the NBS was not sampled between 2010 and 2017, and the cold-pool extent
started to decrease substantially around 2014; therefore including this covariate results in
estimates that depart somewhat from a “Brownian bridge” between 2010 and 2017, and instead
indicates that population densities of walleye pollock in the NBS increased progressively after
2014 when cold-pool-extent declined prior to 2017. Rather than using the cold-pool covariate for
yellowfin sole, we instead used the mean bottom temperature within the outer and middle domain
strata from an interpolated temperature product. All environmental data used as covariates were
computed within the R package coldpool (https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/coldpool; Rohan et
al., in review). 

We used a Poisson-link delta-model (Thorson 2018) involving two linear predictors, and a gamma
distribution to model positive catch rates. We extrapolated population density to the entire EBS
and NBS in each year, using extrapolation grids that are available within FishStatsUtils, which we
note were updated since 2021 assessment cycle based on new shapefiles developed by J. Conner
(https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/FishStatsUtils). These extrapolation grids are defined using
3705 m (2 nmi) × 3705 m (2 nmi) cells; this results in 36,690 extrapolation-grid cells for the
eastern Bering Sea and 15,079 in the northern Bering Sea. We used bilinear interpolation to
interpolate densities from 750 “knots” to these extrapolation grid cells; knots were approximately
evenly distributed over space, in proportion to the dimensions of the extrapolation grid. We
estimated geometric anisotropy (how spatial autocorrelation declines with differing rates over
distance in some cardinal directions than others), and included a spatial and spatio-temporal term
for both linear predictors. To facilitate interpolation of density between unsampled years, we
specified that the spatio-temporal fields were structured over time as an AR(1) process (where the
magnitude of autocorrelation was estimated as a fixed effect for each linear predictor). However,
we did not include any temporal correlation for intercepts, which we treated as fixed effects for
each linear predictor and year. Finally, we used epsilon bias-correction to correct for
retransformation bias (Thorson and Kristensen 2016). 

We checked model fits for evidence of non-convergence by confirming that (1) the derivative of the
marginal likelihood with respect to each fixed effect was sufficiently small and (2) that the
Hessian matrix was positive definite.  We then checked for evidence of model fit by computing
Dunn-Smyth randomized quantile residuals (Dunn and Smyth 1996) and visualizing these using a
quantile-quantile plot within the DHARMa R package.  We also evaluated the distribution of these
residuals over space in each year, and inspected them for evidence of residual spatio-temporal
patterns.  

## Spatio-temporal treatment of survey age composition data

For model-based estimation of age
   compositions in the Bering Sea, we fitted observations of numerical abundance-at-age at each
   sampling location. This was made possible by applying a year-specific, region-specific (EBS and
   NBS) age-length key to records of numerical abundance and length-composition. We computed these
   estimates in VAST, assuming a Poisson-link delta-model (Thorson 2018) involving two linear
   predictors, and a gamma distribution to model positive catch rates. We did not include any
   density covariates in estimation of age composition for consistency with models used in the
   previous assessment, and due to computational limitations. We used the same extrapolation grid
   as implemented for abundance indices, but here we modeled spatial and spatiotemporal fields with
   a mesh with coarser spatial resolution than the index model, here using 50 “knots”. This
   reduction in the spatial resolution of the model, relative to that used abundance indices, was
   necessary due to the increased computational load of fitting multiple age categories and using
   epsilon bias-correction. We implemented the same diagnostics to check convergence and model fit
   as those used for abundance indices.

## Diagnostic plots from BTS work
### Encounter-probability component
One can check to ensure that observed encounter frequencies for either low or high
probability samples are within the 95% predictive interval for predicted
encounter probability (Fig. \ref{fig:encounter}. 
Diagnostics for positive-catch-rate component were evaluated using a standard Q-Q plot. 
Qualitatively, the fits to pollock data are reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:eq1} and \ref{fig:qq2}).

### Pearson residuals
Spatially the residual pattern can be evaluated over time. Results for pollock data shows that consistent positive or negative 
residuals accross or within years is limited for the encounter probability component of the model and 
for the positive catch rate component (Figures \ref{fig:pearson1} and \ref{fig:pearson2}, respectively).

-->
### Densities and biomass estimates

Relative densities over time suggests that the biomass of pollock can reflect
abundances in the NBS even in years where samples are unavailable (all years
except 2010, 2017--2019 and 2021; (Fig. \ref{fig:density}). Index values and error terms
(based on diagonal of covariance matrix over time) are shown in Figure \ref{fig:vast_idx}

## Extending VAST to create estimates from acoustic backscatter data

In 2020 we presented an initial spatio-temporal model to the acoustic backscatter data
collected to half meter from the seafloor from RV Oscar Dyson
(1994-2018) and the USV in 2020 following the same extrapolation area as for the BTS analyses.
We anticipate updating this for application as an alternative to the standard acoustic survey
in 2022.
