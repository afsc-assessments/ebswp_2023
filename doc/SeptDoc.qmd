# Background

Presently the Eastern Bering Sea pollock assessment has remained essentially the same for a relatively long period with main changes arising from alternative methods for processing the data prior to application within the assessment model. In 2023, there are again some modest changes in how data are processed (specifically the acoustic data from the bottom-trawl survey data, so-called "AVO" has been reanalyzed). In addition, we updated and re-evaluate some of the other input data specifications and also begin to examine some alternative model platforms.

Table 1 below shows the model evaluations examined, the naming convention used, and the relevant comparisons and notes.

# Methods

# Weight-at-age used for spawning biomass

Traditionally, the spawning biomass body weight-at-age used for the pollock assessment was set to be equal to the fishery values which vary over time. This was selected mainly because there are more samples than those available from any survey data and included periods when pollock peak spawning occurs (in early spring / late winter). Additionally, the methods used to estimate near-term weight-at-age considers the recent mean values, the estimation uncertainty of those means (i.e., inverse-variance weighted), and accounts for cohort-effects (e.g., see @ianelli2022).

In Ianelli et al. (2007) a method to include predictions and uncertainty estimates in weight-at-age was developed. Briefly, this involved estimating a vector of parameters ($w_{ta}^{future}$) on current (`r thisyr`) and future mean weights for each age $i$, $i$= (1, 2,...,15), given actual observed mean and variances in weight-at-age over the period 1991-`r thisyr-1`. The values of based on available data and (if this option is selected) estimates the parameters subject to the natural constraint: $$w_{ta}^{future} \sim \mathcal{N}(\bar{w_{a}},\,\sigma_{w_a}^{2})$$

Subsequently, this method was refined to account for current-year survey (\@indivero2023) data and both cohort and year effects. The model for this is: \begin{align}
\hat{w}_{ta} &= \bar w_a e^{\upsilon_t} & a=1, \, t \ge 1964 \\
\hat{w}_{ta} &= \hat{w}_{t-1,a-1} + \Delta_a e^{\psi_t} & a > 1, \, t > 1964 \\
\Delta_a     &= \bar w_{a+1} - \bar w_a & a<A  \\
\bar w_a     &= \alpha \left\{L_1+ \left(L_2-L_1\right)\left(\frac{1-K^{a-1}}{1-K^{A-1}}\right)\right\}^3  \\
\end{align} where the fixed effects parameters are $L_1, L_2, K,$ and $\alpha$ while the random effects parameters are $\upsilon_t$ and $\psi_t$.

# Results

## Alternative error-term specifications

In this section we present the updated error terms associated with the acoustic trawl data (the observations used previously were revised). We also show the impact of using the diagonal covariance matrix and an alternative for the bottom trawl survey data based on the generalized gamma distribution in place of the log-normal.

@bailey2000

Updating the ATS data resulted in a different fit to the data trend of those data due to the lower overall uncertainty of the observations specified in revision (@fig-atsalt). This change had a minor impact on the recent estimates of spawning biomass (@fig-atsaltssb).

Changing the bottom-trawl survey error to be based on independent annual survey index values (the base model used a covariance matrix estimated for the series) changed the trend of spawning biomass and uncertainty slightly (@fig-diagssb).

These model estimates for alternative error assumptions indicated that the shows results on goodness of fits while (@tbl-modfitserr) @tbl-modreferr shows the impact of different spawning biomass weights-at-age assumptions.

## Spawning biomass weight-at-age

The random effects model used to estimate weight-at-age for the spawning biomass was based on the A-season fishery, the summer survey data (scaled to have the same mean as the A-season means) shows distinct year and cohort effects (@fig-ssbwt). Compared to the values used in the base model, the trends are very similar but the scales change substantially in some years (@fig-ssbwt ; including the "SSB0" scenario).

@tbl-modfitsssb shows results on goodness of fits while

@tbl-modrefssb shows the impact of different spawning biomass weights-at-age assumptions. Changing the specification of mean body weight-at-age for spawning pollock from status quo had a fairly big impact on the pattern of spawning biomass but among the new alternatives, the difference was minor (@fig-ssbssb).

## Alternative AVO data treatment

The new time series of data for the AVO data shows a peak estimate in 2015 and less of an increase in 2019-2022 (@fig-avodata).

@tbl-modfitsavo shows the impact of different AVO data assumptions.

@tbl-modrefavo shows the impact of different AVO data assumptions.

Selectivity at age

# Summary

Based on the results presented, we recommend:

-   adopting the revised error structure estimates from the acoustic trawl survey. *these are the best available and reflect a reasonable trade-off*

-   adopting the use of the A-season fishery mean body weight-at-age for the base assessment. *these observations reflect the pattern most available to the spawning season of pollock*

-   adopting the use of the full revised AVO time series. *the data have been recalibrated to the acoustic trawl survey and cover a larger area than previously. This may improve the ability to track expansion and contraction of the pollock stock in mid-water.*
