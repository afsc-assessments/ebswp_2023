# Executive summary

This chapter covers the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) region---the Aleutian
Islands region (Chapter 1A) and the Bogoslof Island area (Chapter 1B)
are presented separately. A multi-species stock assessment is provided
separately and available
[here](https://apps-afsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/Plan_Team/2022/EBSmultispp.pdf).

### Summary of changes in assessment inputs

Relative to last year's BSAI SAFE report, the following substantive
changes have been made in the EBS pollock stock assessment. This
includes the `r thisyr` NMFS bottom-trawl survey (BTS) covering the EBS
and NBS. As before, these data were treated with a spatio temporal model
for index standardization. Age data from this survey effort was compiled
and included (also with an extensive spatio-temporal model treatment).
The NMFS acoustic-trawl survey (ATS) was completed covering the EBS and 
a northern extension region north of the core shelf survey area.
The BTS chartered boats also collected acoustic data and the series was
updated this year (AVO).

#### Changes in the data

1.  Observer data for catch-at-age and average weight-at-age from the
    `r lastyr` fishery were finalized and included.

2.  Total catch as reported by NMFS Alaska Regional office was updated
    and included through `r thisyr`.

3.  In summer `r thisyr`, the AFSC conducted the bottom trawl survey in
    the EBS and extended into the NBS. A VAST model evaluation
    (including the cold-pool extent) was used as the main index.

4.  An improved treatment of the weight-at-age data from the BTS was
    presented to the Plan Team and SSC in September 2022 and these have
    replaced values used in the past where constant length-weight
    parameters had been assumed.

5.  The bottom trawl survey collected acoustic data opportunistically
    with the index covering 2006-2022 (except for 2020).

6.  The MACE Program completed an acoustic-trawl survey (ATS) aboard the NOAA 
    ship Oscar Dyson in 2022. Pollock numbers and biomass at length estimates 
    were generated and a preliminary age composition was included based on the 
    BTS age-length data plus a juvenile sample from the ATS. Transects were also 
    extended northward to investigate the presence of pollock beyond the core EBS shelf area.


### Changes in the assessment methods

There were some minor changes to the assessment model to enhance some of the
output variables and to accommodate evaluating the posterior distribution via
MCMC.

## Summary of EBS pollock results

The concern over low survey abundance estimates in 2021 was alleviated
since the three main indices all show an increase over the previous
observations. This also coincides with data indicating that the
2018 year class was one of the most abundant on record.

The following table is based on results from Model "20", as used for last
year's assessment. The ABC recommendation is based on Tier 3 calculation 
as a proxy for Tier 1 because of the variability indicated by the very high
value based on the $F_{MSY}$ estimate and the large but uncertain 2018 year class.
<!-- about 24% below $F_{MSY}$. The Tier 3 ABC estimate for `r nextyr` and 
`r nextyr+1` would be `r M$Tier3_ABC1s` and `r M$Tier3_ABC2s` t,
respectively.

## Response to SSC and Plan Team comments

### General comments

*From several SSC comments in the past few years related to reviewing
the support for retaining the EBS Pollock assessment in Tier 1 versus
reclassifying it as Tier 3.*

-   Consideration of whether the observed sensitivity in the SRR to
    prior specification should constitute an increased risk level
    specification within the assessment or population dynamics related
    considerations. This could provide a clearer justification for the
    use of the Tier 3 calculation as the basis for harvest
    specification.

    -   *We evaluated factors affecting the Tier classification in the
        2020 assessment and showed that the priors used reflect the SRR
        curve were conservative and justified based on residual patterns
        near the origin (as opposed to alternatives that fit data on the
        descending slope of the Ricker SRR.*

-   The SSC recommends that if the assessment is considered in the
    appropriate Tier, buffers should be based on the use of the Risk
    Table rather than the continued use of Tier 3 calculations for a
    Tier 1 stock.

    -   *We agree.*

-   The SSC also notes that an alternative approach to consider for a
    buffer below the maximum permissible would be apply Tier 2 control
    rule. This tier uses the SR relationship for stock status and OFL,
    but uses the ratio of SPR rates for adjustments when the stock is
    below $B_{MSY}$.

    -   *An examination of Tier 2 as an option resulted in a value of
        `r M$Tier2_ABC1s` t (or a hybrid of Tier 1 and 2 of
        `r M$Tier1.5_ABC1s` t) for `r nextyr` ABC values. We note that
        selecting Tier 2 would require similar reliance on the
        underlying productivity estimates (via the stock-recruitment
        relationship) and how that affects the reference fishing rate
        (*$F_{MSY}$).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The SSC had a number of recommendations for additional research
supporting this assessment:**

**From previous requests:**

The SSC also looks forward to estimates of movement and abundance along
the US-Russia EEZ boundary based on echosounders fixed to moorings in
this area.

-   *The data evaluation from the moored sounders is presently underway. Initial
    results hold promise and should be available in early 2023.*

# Introduction

## General

Walleye pollock (*Gadus chalcogrammus*; hereafter referred to as
pollock) are broadly distributed throughout the North Pacific with the
largest concentrations found in the Eastern Bering Sea. Also known as
Alaska pollock, this species continues to play important roles
ecologically and economically.

## Review of Life History

In the EBS pollock spawn generally in the period March-May and in
relatively localized regions during specific periods (Bailey 2000).
Generally spawning begins nearshore north of Unimak Island in March and
April and later near the Pribilof Islands (Jung et al. 2006, Bacheler et
al. 2010). Females are batch spawners with up to 10 batches of eggs per
female per year (during the peak spawning period). 
Eggs and larvae of EBS pollock are planktonic for a
period of about 90 days and appear to be sensitive to environmental
conditions. These conditions likely affect their dispersal into
favorable areas (for subsequent separation from predators) and also
affect general food requirements for over-wintering survival (Gann et
al. 2015, Heintz et al., 2013, Hunt et al. 2011, Ciannelli et al. 2004).
Duffy-Anderson et al. (2015) provide a review of the early life history
of EBS pollock.

Throughout their range juvenile pollock feed on a variety of planktonic
crustaceans, including calanoid copepods and euphausiids. In the EBS
shelf region, one-year-old pollock are found throughout the water
column, but also commonly occur in the NMFS bottom trawl survey. Ages 2
and 3 year old pollock are rarely caught in summer bottom trawl survey
gear and are more common in the midwater zone as detected by mid-water
acoustic trawl surveys. Younger pollock are generally found in the more
northern parts of the survey area and appear to move to the southeast as
they age (Buckley et al. 2009). Euphausiids, principally *Thysanoessa
inermis* and *T. raschii*, are among the most important prey items for
pollock in the Bering Sea (Livingston, 1991; Lang et al., 2000; Brodeur
et al., 2002; Cianelli et al., 2004; Lang et al., 2005). Pollock diets
become more piscivorous with age, and cannibalism has been commonly
observed in this region. However, Buckley et al. (2015) showed spatial
patterns of pollock foraging by size of predators. For example, the
northern part of the shelf region between the 100 and 200 m isobaths
(closest to the shelf break) tends to be more piscivorous than
counterparts in other areas.

## Stock structure

Stock structure for EBS pollock was evaluated in Ianelli
et al. (2015). In that review past work on genetics (e.g., Bailey et al.
1999, Canino et al. 2005) provided insight on genetic differentiation.
The investigation also compared synchrony in year-classes and growth
patterns. Pollock samples from areas including Zhemchug Canyon, Japan,
Prince William Sound, Bogoslof, Shelikof, and the Northern Bering Sea
were processed and results presented in 2021. 
This analysis included 617 walleye 
pollock from Japan, Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Aleutian Islands, Alaska 
Peninsula, and Gulf of Alaska. Results suggests there is temporally 
stable stock structure with a latitudinal gradient, i.e.,
 Bering Sea pollock are distinguishable from those in the
 Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands (I. Spies, personal communication, 2021). 
 Notably, Bogoslof samples appeared genetically distinct from other spawning regions. 
 In addition, there appeared to be genetic connectivity between the eastern 
 Bering Sea and the western Gulf of Alaska spawning samples. Samples 
 from the eastern Gulf of Alaska are currently undergoing sequencing to 
 determine whether eastern Gulf of Alaska pollock are 
genetically distinct from those in the western Gulf of Alaska. 
The ongoing goals of the project include investigating the genetic stock structure of walleye pollock,
testing if patterns are temporally stable, and evaluating if
distributional shifts under climate change can be detected. 

For management purposes, the preliminary conclusions from these genetics
results are: 1)there is stock structure in pollock that appears to be
stable through time and 2) Some aspect of stock structure is
latitudinal---Bering Sea pollock appear distinct from fish collected
from the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. The results appear
strong enough that a GTseq panel could be designed in the future to
determine stock of origin of walleye pollock, the scale of which may be
relatively large, such as "Bering Sea" or "GOA". The scope and funding
sources for this project will be planned in 2022 with sampling designs
developed for implementation as early as 2023.

# Fishery

## Description of the directed fishery

Historically, EBS pollock catches were low until directed foreign
fisheries began in 1964. Catches increased rapidly during the late 1960s
and reached a peak in 1970--75 when they ranged from 1.3 to 1.9 million
t annually. Following the peak catch in 1972, bilateral agreements with
Japan and the USSR resulted in reductions. During a 10-year period,
catches by foreign vessels operating in the "Donut Hole" region of the
Aleutian Basin were substantial totaling nearly 7 million t (Table
\ref{tab:catch}). A fishing moratorium for this area was enacted in 1993
and only trace amounts of pollock have been harvested from the Aleutian
Basin region since then. Since the late 1970s, the average EBS pollock
catch has been about 1.2 million t, ranging from 0.810 million t in 2009
to nearly 1.5 million t during 2002--2006 (Table \ref{tab:catch}).
United States vessels began fishing for pollock in 1980 and by 1988 the
fishery became fully domestic. The current observer program for the
domestic fishery formally began in 1991 and prior to that, observers
were deployed aboard the foreign and joint-venture operations since the
late 1970s. From the period 1991 to 2011 about 80% of the catch was
observed at sea or during dockside offloading. Since 2011, regulations
require that all vessels participating in the pollock fishery carry at
least one observer so nearly 100% of the pollock fishing operations are
monitored by scientifically trained observers. Historical catch
estimates used in the assessment, along with management measures (i.e.,
OFLs, ABCs and TACs) are shown in Table \ref{tab:abc_tac}.

### Catch patterns

The "A-season" for directed EBS pollock fishing opens on January 20th
and fishing typically extends into early-mid April. During this season
the fishery targets pre-spawning pollock and produces pollock roe that,
under optimal conditions, can comprise over 4% of the catch in weight.
The summer, or "B-season" presently opens on June 10th and fishing
extends through noon on November 1st. The A-season fishery concentrates
primarily north and west of Unimak Island depending on ice conditions
and fish distribution. There has also been effort along the 100m depth
contour (and deeper) between Unimak Island and the Pribilof Islands. The
general pattern by season (and area) has varied over time with recent
B-season catches occurring in the southeast portion of the shelf (east
of 170$^\circ$W longitude; Fig. \ref{fig:catch}). Since 2011,
regulations and industry-based measures to reduce Chinook salmon bycatch
have affected the spatial distribution of the fishery and to some
degree, the way individual vessel operators fish (Stram and Ianelli,
2014). In 2020, the fishing fleet encountered higher than normal bycatch
of herring and this has further constrained the fishing grounds due to
area closures. Additionally, sablefish appear to be highly abundant in
the region and have comprised a significant proportion of the incidental
catches in the pollock fishery (proportionally still less than 1% of the
total landings). Comparing encounters of bycatch relative to the effort
(total duration of all tows) the pollock fleet had a relatively flat
trend in the Chinook salmon bycatch while sablefish and herring was down
from the relatively high levels last year (Fig. \ref{fig:fsh_psc_cpue}).

The catch estimates by sex for the seasons indicate that over time, the
number of males and females has been fairly equal but in the period
2017-2020 the A-season catch of females has been slightly higher and
conversely, in the B-season there has been a slightly higher number of
males taken (Fig. \ref{fig:catch_sex}). This figure is updated through 2021
and shows the high numbers of fish taken in that year because they were 
smaller than average. 
The 2022 A-season fishery
spatial pattern had a higher concentrations of fishing near
Unimak and east compared to 2020 and 2021 (Fig. \ref{fig:catch_distn_a}). 
The amount of fishing near the Pribilof Islands was much lower than 
commonly observed in 2022. The 2022 A-season nominal catch
rates were lower than the 2020 peak (for the fleet in aggregate) (Fig.
\ref{fig:fsh_cpue}). Beginning in 2017, due to a regulatory change, up
to 45% of the TAC could be taken in the A-season (previously only 40% of
the TAC could be taken). This conservation measure was made to allow
greater flexibility to avoid Chinook salmon in the B-season. The pollock fleet 
as a whole continues to take advantage of this 
flexibility (Fig. \ref{fig:prop_a_season}). However, this figure
indicates that in 2022, the proportion of catch in February increased over the
2021 pattern and this was consistent in subsequent months as well. This
suggests that fishing conditions were improved.
Pollock roe is an important product coming from the winter fishery. The amount
produced in the 2022 A-season was the lowest since 2013 and 
continued the big drop from the previous year (Fig. \ref{fig:roe}).

The summer-fall fishing conditions for 2022 improved considerably over
2021 and was about average on nominal catch rates (Fig.
\ref{fig:fsh_cpue}). The number of hours the fleet required to catch the
same tonnage of pollock was also improved relative to 2020. In the
B-season catches in the northwestern area dropped relative to the
previous two years (Fig. \ref{fig:catch_distn_b}). In addition, we
present an approach first shown in 2019 to evaluate how concentrated the
fleet was on average. We called this a measure of fleet dispersion: the
relative distance or spread of the fishery in space. Briefly, the
calculation computes for a given day, the distance between all trawl
tows (within and across boats). These distances are then averaged for
year and season. Updated to this year, results indicated that in both
seasons the fleet was less dispersed than last year suggesting that
fishing was fairly concentrated without a need to fish in more places
(Fig \ref{fig:fleet_dispersal}).

We continued to investigate the tow specific mean weight of fish. 
These provide a direct mean somatic mass (pollock body
weight) for pollock within a tow. The data arise from the sampled
total weight (e.g., of several baskets of pollock) divided by the
enumerated number of fish in that sample. Such records exist for each
tow. Summing these by extrapolated weight of the pollock catch within
that tow, and binning by weight increments (here by 50 gram intervals),
allows us to obtain some additional fine-scale information on the size
trends in the pollock fishery. The annual patterns of these data show
that overall, the B-season of 2020 was different with the small mode of
fish persisting into the 2021 B-season (Fig. \ref{fig:fsh_wt_freq}).
Compiling the data by week we show that the fish size was consistent
the growth of the 2018 year class during this B-season (Fig. \ref{fig:fsh_wt_freq_week}).

The catch of EBS pollock has averaged 1.26 million t in the period since
1979. The lowest catches occurred in 2009 and 2010 when the limits were
set to 0.81 million t due to stock declines (Table \ref{tab:abc_tac}).
The recent 5-year average (2018-2022) catch has been 1.326 million t.
Pollock catches that are retained or discarded (based on NMFS observer
estimates) in the Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands for
1991--`r thisyr` are shown in Table \ref{tab:catch_disc}. Since 1991,
estimates of discarded pollock have ranged from a high of 9.6% of total
pollock catch in 1991 to recent lows of around 0.6% to 1.1%. These low values
reflect the implementation of the NMFS' Improved Retention /Improved
Utilization program. Prior to the implementation of the American
Fisheries Act (AFA) in 1999, higher discards may have occurred under the
"race for fish" and pollock marketable sizes were caught incidentally.
Since implementation of the AFA, the vessel operators have more time to
pursue optimal sizes of pollock for market since the quota is allocated
to vessels (via cooperative arrangements). In addition, several vessels
have made gear modifications to avoid retention of smaller pollock. In
all cases, the magnitude of discards counts as part of the total catch
for management (to ensure the TAC is not exceeded) and within the
assessment. Bycatch of other non-target, target, and prohibited species
is presented in the section titled Ecosystem Considerations below. In
that section it is noted that the bycatch of pollock in other target
fisheries is more than double the bycatch of other target species (e.g.,
Pacific cod) in the pollock fishery.

## Management measures

The EBS pollock stock is managed by NMFS regulations that provide limits
on seasonal catch. The NMFS observer program data provide near real-time
statistics during the season and vessels operate within well-defined
limits. In most years, the TACs have been set well below the ABC value
and catches have stayed within these constraints (Table
\ref{tab:abc_tac}). Allocations of the TAC split first with 10% to
western Alaska communities as part of the Community Development Quota
(CDQ) program and the remainder between at-sea processors and
shore-based sectors. For a characterization of the CDQ program see
Haynie (2014). Seung and Ianelli (2016) combined a fish population
dynamics model with an economic model to evaluate regional impacts.

Due to concerns that groundfish fisheries may impact the rebuilding of
the Steller sea lion population, a number of management measures have
been implemented over the years. Some measures were designed to reduce
the possibility of competitive interactions between fisheries and
Steller sea lions. For the pollock fisheries, seasonal fishery catch and
pollock biomass distributions (from surveys) indicated that the apparent
disproportionately high seasonal harvest rates within Steller sea lion
critical habitat could lead to reduced sea lion prey densities.
Consequently, management measures redistributed the fishery both
temporally and spatially according to pollock biomass distributions.
This was intended to disperse fishing so that localized harvest rates
were more consistent with estimated annual exploitation rates. The
measures include establishing: 1) pollock fishery exclusion zones around
sea lion rookery or haulout sites; 2) phased-in reductions in the
seasonal proportions of TAC that can be taken from critical habitat; and
3) additional seasonal TAC releases to disperse the fishery in time.

Prior to adoption of the above management measures, the pollock fishery
occurred throughout each of the three major NMFS management regions of
the North Pacific Ocean: the Aleutian Islands (1,001,780 km$^2$ inside
the EEZ), the Eastern Bering Sea (968,600 km$^2$), and the Gulf of
Alaska (1,156,100 km$^2$). The marine portion of Steller sea lion
critical habitat in Alaska west of 150$^{\circ}$W encompasses 386,770
km$^2$ of ocean surface, or 12% of the fishery management regions.

From 1995--1999 84,100 km$^2$, or 22% of the Steller sea lion critical
habitat was closed to the pollock fishery. Most of this closure
consisted of the 10 and 20 nm radius all-trawl fishery exclusion zones
around sea lion rookeries (48,920 km$^2$, or 13% of critical habitat).
The remainder was largely management area 518 (35,180 km$^2$, or 9% of
critical habitat) that was closed pursuant to an international agreement
to protect spawning stocks of central Bering Sea pollock. In 1999, an
additional 83,080 km$^2$ (21%) of critical habitat in the Aleutian
Islands was closed to pollock fishing along with 43,170 km$^2$ (11%)
around sea lion haulouts in the GOA and Eastern Bering Sea. In 1998,
over 22,000 t of pollock were caught in the Aleutian Island region, with
over 17,000 t taken within critical habitat region. Between 1999 and
2004 a directed fishery for pollock was prohibited in this region.
Subsequently, 210,350 km$^2$ (54%) of critical habitat in the Aleutian
Islands was closed to the pollock fishery. In 2000 the remaining
phased-in reductions in the proportions of seasonal TAC that could be
caught within the BSAI Steller sea lion Conservation Area (SCA) were
implemented.

On the EBS shelf, an estimate (based on observer at-sea data) of the
proportion of pollock caught in the SCA has averaged about 44% annually.
During the A-season, the average is also about 44%. Nonetheless, the
proportion of pollock caught within the SCA varies considerably,
presumably due to temperature regimes and the relative population age
structure. The annual proportion of catch has ranged from an annual low
of 11% in 2010 to high of 60% in 1998--the 2019 annual value was 58% and
quite high again in the A-season (68%; Ianelli et al. 2020). The higher
values in recent years were likely due to good fishing conditions close
to the main port. The recent transition from at-sea observer sampling of
many catcher vessels to a combination of at-sea electronic monitoring
and shore-based observer sampling has resulted in a temporary hiatus in
to associate catches with specific areas. Work has progressed
to link the position information to offloads so that haul 
records could be used to evaluate fishing patterns.

The AFA reduced the capacity of the catcher/processor fleet and
permitted the formation of cooperatives in each industry sector by the
year 2000. Because of some of its provisions, the AFA gave the industry
the ability to respond efficiently to changes mandated for sea lion
conservation and salmon bycatch measures. Without such a catch-share
program, these additional measures would likely have been less effective
and less economical (Strong and Criddle 2014).

An additional strategy to minimize potential adverse effects on sea lion
populations is to disperse the fishery throughout more of the pollock
range on the Eastern Bering Sea shelf. While the distribution of fishing
during the A-season is limited due to ice and weather conditions, there
appears to be some dispersion to the northwest area (Fig.
\ref{fig:catch_distn_a}).

The majority (about 56%) of Chinook salmon caught as bycatch in the
pollock fishery originate from western Alaskan rivers. This was updated 
at the June 2022 Council meeting and is activities are monitored and reported
closely at the Council ([at this website](https://www.npfmc.org/fisheries-issues/bycatch/salmon-bycatch/ 
).
In summary, Chinook salmon bycatch management measures went into effect in 2011
which imposed revised prohibited species catch (PSC) limits. These limits,
when reached, close the fishery by sector and season (Amendment 91 to
the BSAI Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) resulting from the
NPFMC's 2009 action). Previously, all measures for salmon bycatch
imposed seasonal area closures when PSC levels reached the limit
(fishing could continue outside of the closed areas). The current
program imposes a dual cap system by fishing sector and season. A goal
of this system was to maintain incentives to avoid bycatch at a broad
range of relative salmon abundance (and encounter rates). Participants
are also required to take part in an incentive program agreement (IPA).
These IPAs are approved and reviewed annually by NMFS to ensure
individual vessel accountability. The fishery has been operating under
rules to implement this program since January 2011.

Further measures to reduce salmon bycatch in the pollock fishery were
developed and the Council took action on Amendment 110 to the BSAI
Groundfish FMP in April 2015. These additional measures were designed to
add protection for Chinook salmon by imposing more restrictive PSC
limits in times of low western Alaskan Chinook salmon abundance. This
included provisions within the IPAs that reduce fishing in months of
higher bycatch encounters and mandate the use of salmon excluders in
trawl nets. These provisions were also included to provide more flexible
management measures for chum salmon bycatch within the IPAs rather than
through regulatory provisions implemented by Amendment 84 to the FMP.
The new measure also included additional seasonal flexibility in pollock
fishing so that more pollock (proportionally) could be caught during
seasons when salmon bycatch rates were low. Specifically, an additional
5% of the pollock can be caught in the A-season (effectively changing
the seasonal allocation from 40% to 45% (as noted above in the
discussion assosciated with Fig. \ref{fig:prop_a_season}). These
measures are all part of Amendment 110 and a summary of this and other
key management measures is provided in Table \ref{tab:mgt}.

There are three time/area closures in regulation to minimize herring PSC
impacts: *Summer Herring Savings Area 1* an area south of 57$^\circ$N
latitude and between 162$^\circ$W and 164$^\circ$W longitude from June
15 through July 1st. *Summer Herring Savings Area 2* an area south of
56$^\circ$ 30' N latitude and between 164$^\circ$W and 167$^\circ$W
longitude from July 1 through August 15. *Winter Herring Savings Area*
an area between 58$^\circ$ and 60$^\circ$N latitude and between
172$^\circ$W and 175$^\circ$W longitude from September 1st through March
1st of the next fishing year.

## Fishery

### Catch

Biological sampling by scientifically trained observers form the basis
of a major data component of this assessment (as evaluated in Barbeaux
et al. 2005). The catch-at-age composition was estimated using the
methods described by Kimura (1989) and modified by Dorn (1992).
Length-stratified age data are used to construct age-length keys for
each stratum and sex. These keys are then applied to randomly sampled
catch length frequency data. The stratum-specific age composition
estimates are then weighted by the catch biomass within each stratum to
arrive at an overall age composition for each year. Data were collected
through shore-side sampling and at-sea observers. The three strata for
the EBS were: i) January--June (all areas, but mainly east of
170$^\circ$W); ii) INPFC area 51 (east of 170$^\circ$W) from
July--December; and iii) INPFC area 52 (west of 170$^\circ$W) from
July--December. This method was used to derive the age compositions from
1991--`r lastyr` (the period for which all the necessary information is
readily available). Prior to 1991, we used the same catch-at-age
composition estimates as presented in Wespestad et al. (1996).

The catch-at-age estimation method uses a two-stage bootstrap re-sampling of the
data. Observed tows were first selected with replacement, followed by re-
sampling actual lengths and age specimens given that set of tows. This method
allows an objective way to specify the starting values for the input sample
size for fitting fishery age composition data within the assessment model. In
addition, estimates of stratum-specific fishery mean weights-at-age
(and variances) are provided which are useful for evaluating general patterns
in growth and growth variability. For example, Ianelli et al. (2007) showed
that seasonal aspects of pollock condition factor could affect estimates of
mean weight-at-age. They showed that within a year, the condition factor for
pollock varies by more than 15%, with the heaviest pollock caught late in the
year from October-December (although most fishing occurs during other times of
the year) and the thinnest fish at length tending to occur in late winter.
They also showed that spatial patterns in the fishery affect mean weights, particularly
when the fishery is shifted more towards the northwest where pollock tend to be
smaller at age. Grüss et al. (2021) showed cold-pool-extent impacts
on the spatial map of summer condition and relating environmental conditions to
fish condition continues to be an active area of research. 

In 2011 the winter fishery catch consisted primarily of age 5
pollock (the 2006 year class) and later in that year age 3 pollock (the 2008
year class) were present. In 2012--2016 the 2008 year class was prominent in
the catches with 2015 showing the first signs of the 2012 year-class as three
year-olds in the catch (Fig. \ref{fig:catage}; Table \ref {tab:fsh_age}). 
However, by 2017 the 2013 year-class began to be also evident
and surpassed the 2012 year-class in dominance and persist through to 2021.
The unusual pattern of switching adjacent
year-classes was examined in 2021 to see if there was a pattern of spatial
differences. There was a distinct spatial distribution of the different year-classes.
Having adjacent strong year-classes appears to be a new characteristic of the stock.
In 2020, an unusual presence of age-2 pollock appeared in the catch, along with
some from the 2014 year-class while the 2012 year-class was a smaller part of the
catch (Fig. \ref{fig:catage}). By 2021, the predominance of 3-year olds in the catch
seems to confirm that there is an abundant year-class from 2018. 


The sampling effort for age determinations, weight-length measurements,
and length frequencies is shown in Tables \ref{tab:fsh_meas},
\ref{tab:lw_meas}, and \ref{tab:fsh_n}. Sampling for pollock lengths and
ages by area has been shown to be relatively proportional to catches
(e.g., Fig. 1.8 in Ianelli et al. 2004). The precision of total pollock
catch biomass is considered high with estimated CVs to be on the order
of 1% (Miller 2005).

Scientific research catches are reported to fulfill requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act. The annual
estimated research catches (1963--2020) from NMFS surveys in the Bering
Sea and Aleutian Islands Region are given in (Table
\ref{tab:res_catch}). Since these values represent extremely small
fractions of the total removals (about 0.02%) they are ignored for
assessment purposes.

## Surveys

### Bottom trawl survey (BTS)

Trawl surveys have been conducted annually by the AFSC to assess the
abundance of crab and groundfish in the Eastern Bering Sea since 1979
and since 1982 using standardized gear and methods. For pollock, this
survey has been instrumental in providing an abundance index and
information on the population age structure. This survey is complemented
by the acoustic trawl (AT) surveys that sample mid-water components of
the pollock stock. Between 1991 and 2022 the BTS biomass estimates
ranged from 2.28 to 8.39 million t (Table \ref{tab:bts_biom} for the design-based
estimates). The values used for the assessment (VAST index, see appendix for details) 
are provided in  Fig. \ref{fig:bts_biom}). 
In the mid-1980s and early 1990s several years
resulted in above-average biomass estimates. The stock appeared to be at
lower levels during 1996--1999 then increased moderately until about
2003 and since then has averaged just over 4 million t (from the
standard EBS region using design-based estimators). These surveys also
provide consistent measurements of environmental conditions, such as the
sea surface and bottom temperatures. Large-scale zoogeographic shifts in
the EBS shelf documented during a warming trend in the early 2000s were
attributed to temperature changes (e.g., Mueter and Litzow 2008).
However, after the period of relatively warm conditions ended in 2005,
the next eight years were mainly below average, indicating that the
zoogeographic responses may be less temperature-dependent than they
initially appeared (Kotwicki and Lauth 2013). Bottom temperatures
increased in 2011 to about average from the low value in 2010 but
declined again in 2012--2013. However, in the period 2014--2016, bottom
temperatures increased and reached a new high in 2016. In 2018 bottom
temperatures were nearly as warm (after 2017 was slightly above average)
but was highly unusual due to the complete lack of "cold pool" (i.e., a
defined area where water near bottom was less than zero degrees. In
2019, the mean bottom temperature was the warmest during the period the
survey has occurred (since 1982; Fig. \ref{fig:bts_temp}). 
In 2022, the temperatures on bottom were more average with a relatively
extensive cold pool extent.

The AFSC has expanded the area covered by the bottom trawl survey over
time. In 1987 the "standard survey area" comprising 6 main strata was
increased farther to the northwest and covered in all subsequent years.
These two northern strata have varied in estimated pollock abundance. In
2022 about 9% of the pollock biomass was found in these strata compared
to a long term average of 5% (Table \ref{tab:bts_biom}). Importantly,
this region is contiguous with the Russian border and the NBS region,
and treatment of the extent stock shifts between regions continues
(e.g., O'leary et al. 2021).

The 2022 survey estimate increased 35% from the 2021 value and is 
about 95% of the long term mean estimate. 
This coincided with a return to more average cold water on
the bottom throughout the survey area (Fig. \ref{fig:bts_temp_cpue}).
In 2022, pollock appeared to be 
mainly distributed over the outer shelf area compared to recent years 
(Fig. \ref{fig:bts_3d}).

The BTS abundance-at-age estimates show variability in year-class
strengths with substantial consistency over time (Fig.
\ref{fig:bts_age}). Pollock above 40 cm in length generally appear to be
fully selected and in some years many 1-year olds occur on or near the
bottom (with modal lengths around 10--19 cm). Generally speaking, age 2
or 3 pollock (lengths around 20--29 cm and 30--39 cm, respectively) are
relatively rare in this survey because they tend to be more pelagic as
juveniles. Compared to 2021, this year showed size compositions consistent with
the mid-range categories and consistent with the age data (Fig. \ref{fig:bts_lenfreq}).
The relatively high abundance of 4-year old pollock in this
years survey indicates that the 2018 year class persisted, despite that
group comprising much of the fishery as 3-year olds in 2021.


Observed fluctuations in survey estimates may be attributed to a variety
of sources including unaccounted-for variability in natural mortality,
survey catchability, and **horizontal** migrations and **vertical availability**
(Monnahan et al., 2021; O’Leary et al., 2022). As an example, some strong year
classes appear in the surveys over several ages (e.g., the 1989 year
class) while others appear only at older ages (e.g., the 1992 and 2008
year class). Sometimes initially strong year classes appear to wane in
successive assessments (e.g., the 1996 year class estimate (at age 1)
dropped from 43 billion fish in 2003 to 32 billion in 2007 (Ianelli et
al. 2007)). Retrospective analyses (e.g., Parma 1993) have also
highlighted these patterns, as presented in Ianelli et al. (2006, 2011).
Kotwicki et al. (2013) also found that the catchability of either the
BTS or AT survey for pollock is variable in space and time because it
depends on environmental variables, and is density-dependent in the case
of the BTS survey.

The 2022 survey age compositions were developed from age-structures
collected during the survey (June-July) and processed at the AFSC labs
within a few weeks after the survey was completed. The level of sampling
for lengths and ages in the BTS is shown in Table \ref{tab:bts_n}. The
estimated numbers-at- age from the BTS for strata 1--9 (except for
1982--84 and 1986, when only strata 6 were surveyed) are presented in
Table \ref{tab:bts_age} (based on the method in Kotwicki et al. 2014 and 
then using VAST--see appendix for those details). Compared to the previous
design-based age composition estimates, those derived from the spatio-temporal
model were generally very similar (Fig. \ref{fig:bts_vast_age}). 

In the previous assessments, the BTS mean body mass-at-ages was computed
based on the sex-specific mean length-at-age in each year and converted to
weight using sex-specific length-weight parameters that were estimated from
data prior to 1999. In reconsidering this approach, data on weight-at-age 
from intervening years have become available and some new methods applied 
including those corrected by spatio-temporal modeling (J. Indivero, pers. comm).
This work was presented to the Plan Team and SSC for the October 2022 Council
meeting. As the results from this new study is in review, the Council advised
to use the available data in a basic way prior to advancing to the full spatio-temporal
approach. As such, the revised survey station-specific density estimates applied 
to the weight-at-age data resulted in revised estimates. These are compared
in Figure \ref{fig:btswtage_comparison} and provided in Table
\ref{tab:wt_bts}.  The time series of BTS survey indices is shown in Table \ref{tab:bts_abund}.

The NBS survey area was sampled in 2010, 2017, 2018 (limited to 49
stations), in 2019, 2021 and again this year. Given that the pollock abundance
was quite high in 2017 and 2018, a method for incorporating this
information as part of the standard survey was desired. One approach for
constructing a full time series that included the NBS area is to use
observed spatial and temporal correlations. We used the
vector-autoregressive spatial temporal (VAST) model of Thorson (2018b)
together with the density- dependent corrected CPUE values from each
station (including stations where pollock were absent; Table
\ref{tab:bts_abund}). Please refer to the appendix for further details
on the implementation. The appendix also shows results that indicate the
VAST model diagnostics are reasonable and provide consistent
interpretations relative to the observations. Notably, results indicate
increased uncertainty in years and areas when stations were missing. As
noted in past assessments, application of this index within the stock
assessment model required accounting for the time-series covariance
estimate.

To date, given other commitments work on comparing the age-and-growth from
NBS samples has stalled. We hope to evaluate these data when they become available in 
the near future to look at maturity and growth conditions from this region.

### Acoustic trawl surveys

Acoustic trawl surveys are typically conducted every other year and are designed
to estimate the off- bottom component of the pollock stock (compared to the BTS
which are conducted annually and provide an abundance index of the near-bottom
pollock). Estimated pollock biomass for the EBS shelf has averaged over 3.2
million t since the time-series was revised to include the water column to 0.5
m (from the historical midwater pollock index to 3 m off bottom) starting in
1994 (Table \ref{tab:bts_abund}). 
The early 2000s (a relatively ‘warm’ period)
were characterized by low pollock recruitment, which was subsequently reflected
in lower pollock biomass estimates between 2006 and 2012 (a ‘cold’ period;
Honkalehto and McCarthy 2015). In 2014 and 2016 (another ‘warm’ period) with
the growth of the strong 2012 year class, AT biomass estimates increased to
over 4 million t (Table \ref{tab:bts_abund}). 
The number of trawl hauls, lengths, and ages sampled from
the AT survey are presented in Table \ref{tab:ats_n}.
These surveys have also provided insight on the relative abundance of 
pollock in areas considered critical to Steller sea lions (the “SCA”; 
Table \ref{tab:ats_biom}). 

Eastern Bering Sea shelf walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) midwater
abundance and distribution were assessed from Bristol Bay to the U.S.-Russia
Convention Line from 1 June to 5 August 2022 using acoustic-trawl (AT) survey
methods aboard the NOAA ship _Oscar Dyson_. In addition to the traditional
(core) survey area, a region north of most transects (the northern extension)
was surveyed. Transect spacing, typically 20 nmi, ranged from 40 nmi in the
east and middle shelf to 20 nmi in the western shelf due to ship staffing
constraints and uncertainties over the survey schedule. 

The estimated amount of pollock in midwater (between 16 m from the sea surface
and 0.5 m off the sea floor) in the U.S. EEZ core survey area was 9.67 billion
fish with a biomass of 3.834 million metric tons (t), just over a 50% increase
from the estimate of 5.57 billion fish with a biomass of 2.499 million t in
2018, the last time a standard acoustic-trawl survey was conducted on the
Eastern Bering Sea shelf. This is a 6% increase over the estimate of 3.605
million t in 2020 made by the acoustics-only Saildrone survey. Pollock east of
170^\circ$W numbered 2.99 billion fish and weighed 1.361 million t (36% of the
total biomass found in the core survey area, and 31% of the biomass found shelf-wide,
including the northern extension). Pollock abundance west of 170W was 6.68
billion fish weighing 2.473 million t (64% of total core survey area biomass
and 57% of the shelf-wide biomass). Preliminary age results using age-length
information from the BT survey and 100 AT survey juvenile ages indicated that
four year-old pollock (34 to 40 cm mean fork length (FL)) composed 57% of the
biomass in the core survey area (Fig. \ref{fig:at_age}). Slightly more than one-half million t
(0.539 million t) of pollock were observed distributed sparsely along the
northern extension transects, 12% of the shelf-wide total.

Relative estimation errors for the total biomass were derived from a one-dimensional 
(1D) geostatistical method, which accounts for observed spatial structure for 
sampling along transects (Petitgas 1993, Walline 2007, Williamson and Traynor 1996). 
The 2022 relative estimation error for the core survey area was 0.068, slightly 
higher than the time series mean of 0.043, likely due to increased transect spacing. 
As in previous assessments, the other sources of error (e.g., target strength, 
trawl selectivity) were accounted for by inflating the annual error estimates 
to have an overall average CV of 20% for application within the assessment model. 
The age composition data from the ATS sampling are provided in 
Table \ref{tab:ats_age}).


## Other time series used in the assessment

### Japanese fishery CPUE index

An available time series relating the abundance of pollock during the
period 1965--1976 was included. This series is based on Japanese fishery
catch rates which used the same size class of trawl vessels as presented
in Low and Ikeda (1980). A coefficient of variation of 20% was applied.

### Biomass index from Acoustic-Vessels-of-Opportunity (AVO)

Acoustic backscatter data (Simrad ES60, 38 kHz) were collected aboard
two fishing vessels chartered for the AFSC summer 2022 bottom trawl
surveys (F/V Alaska Knight, F/V Vesteraalen). These Acoustic Vessels of
Opportunity (AVO) data were processed according to Honkalehto et al.
(2011) to provide an index of age-1+ midwater pollock abundance in each
year.

The 2022 AVO index of midwater pollock abundance on the eastern Bering
Sea shelf increased by 16% from 2021 and is the highest value on
record (14% higher than the next highest value recorded in 2015) (Table
\ref{tab:avo}; note the AVO data were unavailable in 2020 since the BTS
was canceled). Spatially, the total pollock backscatter observed east of
the Pribilof Islands during the summers of 2010-2012 ranged from 4-9%.
Since 2013 the backscatter from this area ranged between 15% and 25%
(Fig. \ref{fig:data_avomap}).

# Analytic approach

## General model structure

A statistical age-structured assessment model conceptually outlined in
Fournier and Archibald (1982) and like Methot's (1990) stock synthesis
model was applied over the period 1964--`r thisyr`. A technical
description is presented in the "EBS Pollock Model Description"
appendix. The analysis was first introduced in the 1996 SAFE report and
compared to the cohort analyses that had been used previously and was
later documented in Ianelli and Fournier (1998). The model was written
in ADMB---a library for non-linear estimation and statistical
applications (Fournier et al. 2012). The data updated from last year's
analyses include:

-   The `r thisyr-1` fishery age composition data were added 

-   The catch biomass estimates were updated through to the current year

-   The `r thisyr` bottom-trawl survey index, weight, and age composition data were 
     revised and added 

-   The `r thisyr` acoustic-trawl survey index, weight, and preliminary age 
     composition data were  added 

-   The AVO backscatter data collected opportunistically from the 2022
    bottom trawl survey and post processed into the AVO backscatter
    index were included.

A simplified version of the assessment (with mainly the same data and
likelihood-fitting method) is included as a supplemental multi-species
assessment model. As presented since 2016, it allows for trophic
interactions among key prey and predator species and for pollock, and it
can be used to evaluate age and time-varying natural mortality estimates
in addition to alternative catch scenarios and management targets (see
this volume: [EBS multi-species
model](https://apps-afsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/Plan_Team/2022/EBSmultispp.pdf)).

## Description of alternative models

In the 2019 assessment, the spatio-temporal model fit to BTS CPUE data
*including stations from the NBS* was expanded using the VAST methods
detailed in Thorson (2018). This data treatment was included as a model
alternative and adopted for ABC/OFL specifications by the SSC in 2020
along with other modifications including a spatio-temporal treatment of
the age composition data. This year, we used the same model
configuration and simply examined the influence of additional data that
became available this year. For projections we added the ability to test
alternative Tier scenarios. The current base model is Model 20.0a, which
was adopted last year by the SSC, and which differed from the previous
base model (Model 16.2) in that it included the 2020 USV acoustic
biomass estimate as an extension of the standard AT survey biomass time
series and excluded the 1978 year class from the estimation of the
stock-recruitment relationship. We examined the following alternative models:

```{=tex}
\begin{description}

\item[20.0]The model selected last year which omitted the 1978 year-class from affecting the SRR (referred to as "Base")

\item[20.1]As 20.0 but estimating $M$ with a prior distribution (referred to as "Est. M")

\item[20.2]As 20.0 but updating the Francis weights (referred to as "Wt Comp").

\end{description}
```
In an effort to test different stock assessment software, we adopted the
pollock data and used some of the model software that was simulation
tested in Li et al. (2021). While preliminary, the results were
consistent with the bespoke model used here. However, the impact of
missing features in the more generalized models tested in this paper
requires more investigation. Specifically, the bespoke model used here
includes an informed fixed-effects model for projecting weight-at-age
and uses a covariance matrix for index time series that is unavailable
in the models tested in Li et al. (2021).

<!-- ### Tier 1 considerations

In the 2020 assessment we examined the factors affecting Tier 1
classifications including the required "reliability" of the estimated
pdf of $F_{MSY}$, i.e., the influence of assumptions related to the
uncertainties on the stock recruitment relationship, body mass-at-age,
maturation, and fishery selectivity. For a number of years the Tier 1
ABC and OFL specifications for EBS pollock have been very high, in
excess of the 2 million t OY for combined groundfish stocks managed
within this FMP area. This has been because the spawning stock estimates
have been well above target and mean levels. To add precaution to these
estimates, ABC recommendations have been below the maximum permissible
under Tier 1 but the rationale for such an adjustment could be improved.
As such, the SSC requested an examination of the issues related to
classifying this stock in Tier 1 versus Tier 3. The FMP (under amendment
56) guides this classification. It notes that a reliable estimate of
$F_{MSY}$ and its uncertainty (as expressed through a probability
distribution or PDF) is required. Since these values depend primarily on
the stock-recruitment relationship (SRR), the following sensitivities
were pursued relative to the status quo (Model 20) configuration:

-   As status quo (i.e., ignoring the influence of the 1978 year class
    on the SRR).

-   As in sensitivity a) but with a less informative prior on steepness

-   As in status quo but the SRR conditioned such that
    $F_{MSY}=F_{35\%}$

-   As in status quo but the SRR conditioned such that
    $F_{MSY}=F_{45\%}$

The first option was intended to reflect that the high value observed of
the 1978 year-class occurred under an estimated low level of spawning
biomass (designated Model 20.0a). The rationale for excluding this
influential value was that the stock structure and environmental
conditions may differ now, indicating non-stationarity in the
relationship. Results showed that it mattered but was relatively minor
and seemed unlikely to disqualify the estimates required for Tier 1.
Sensitivity test b) was intended to illustrate the role of the prior
mean and variance on the steepness estimate. Finally sensitivities c)
and d) were considered as how the SRR may translate an implicit
assumption under Tier 3 since $F_{35\%}$ is a proxy for $F_{MSY}$ and
$F_{45\%}$ is closer to the recent mean SPR rate.
 -->
### Input sample size

Sample sizes for age-composition data were re-evaluated in 2016 against
the trade-off with flexibility in time and age varying selectivity. In subsequent
assessment years the values have changed significantly from the 4-periods
of fishery data from which these weights were applied and calculated.
Principally, this work resulted in tuning the recent era (1991-present year) to an
average sample sizes of 350 for the fishery and then using estimated values for the
period 1978-1990 and as earlier (Table \ref{tab:input_n}). We assumed
average values of 100 and 50 for the BTS and ATS data, respectively with
inter-annual variability reflecting the variability in the number of
hauls sampled for ages. This year we re-evaluated one-step tuning 
as a sensitivity following Francis 2011 (equation TA1.8, hereafter referred to as Francis weights).

Recent work has shown ways to improve estimation schemes that deal with the interaction
between flexibility in fishery selectivity and statistical properties of 
composition data sample size. 
Specifically, the Dirichlet-multinomial using either Laplace approximation (Thorson et al., 2015) or adnuts (Monnahan and
Kristensen, 2018) should be implemented (e.g., as shown by Xu et al., 2020). We hope to evaluate these 
and alternatives in the coming year.

## Parameters estimated outside of the assessment model

### Natural mortality and maturity at age

The baseline model specification has been to use constant natural
mortality rates at age (M=0.9, 0.45, and 0.3 for ages 1, 2, and 3+
respectively (Wespestad and Terry 1984). When predation was explicitly
considered estimates tended to be higher and more variable (Holsman et al.
*this volume*; Holsman et al. 2015; Livingston and Methot 1998; Hollowed
et al. 2000). Clark (1999) found that specifying a conservative (lower)
natural mortality rate may be advisable when natural mortality rates are
uncertain. More recent studies confirm this (e.g., Johnson et al. 2015).

In the supplemental multi-species assessment model alternative values of
age and time-varying natural mortality are presented. As in past years
the estimates indicate higher values than used here. In the 2018
assessment we evaluated natural mortality, and it was noted that the
survey age compositions favored lower values of *M* while the fishery
age composition favored higher values. This is consistent with the
patterns seen in the BTS survey data as they show increased abundances
of "fully selected" cohorts. Hence, given the model specification
(asymptotic selectivity for the BTS age composition data), lower natural
mortality rates would be consistent with those data. Given these
trade-offs, structural model assumptions were held to be the same as
previous years for consistency (i.e., the mortality schedule presented
below).

Maturity-at-age values used for the EBS pollock assessment were
originally based on Smith (1981) and were later reevaluated (e.g., Stahl
2004; Stahl and Kruse 2008a; and Ianelli et al. 2005). These studies
found inter-annual variability but general consistency with the original
schedule of proportion mature at age.

Based on results from a distinct (apparently) but adjacent stock (Bogoslof assessment, this
volume) where fishing 
has been curtailed since 1992 and spawning surveys have taken place with regularity
since then (and included age data) we evaluate as a sensitivity estimated natural mortality for
pollock age 3-yrs and older. For the "base" model (model 2020) we continue to use
assumed natural mortality-at-age and maturity-at-age (for all models; Smith 1981) as in
previous assessments:

### Length and weight-at-age

Age determination methods have been validated for pollock (Kimura et al.
1992; Kimura et al. 2006, and Kastelle and Kimura 2006). EBS pollock
size-at-age show important differences in growth with differences by
area, year, and year class. Pollock in the northwest area are typically
smaller at age than pollock in the southeast area. The differences in
average weight-at-age are taken into account by stratifying estimates of
catch-at-age by year, area, season, and weighting estimates proportional
to catch.

The assessment model for EBS pollock accounts for numbers of individuals
in the population. As noted above, management recommendations are based
on allowable catch levels expressed as tons of fish. While estimates of
pollock catch-at-age are based on large data sets, the data are only
available up until the most recent completed calendar year of fishing
(e.g., 2021 for this year). Consequently, estimates of weight-at-age in
the current year are required to map total catch biomass (typically
equal to the quota) to numbers of fish caught (in the current year).
Therefore, if there are errors (or poorly accounted uncertainty) in the
current and future mean weight-at-age, this can translate directly into
errors between the expected fishing mortality and what mortality occurs.
For example, if the mean weight-at-age is biased high, then an ABC (and
OFL) value will result in greater numbers of fish being caught (and
fishing mortality being higher due to more fish fitting within the ABC).

As in previous assessments, we explored patterns in size-at-age and fish
condition. Using the NMFS fishery observer data on weight given length
we:

1.  extracted all data where non-zero measurements of pollock length and
    weight were available between the lengths of 35 and 60 cm for the
    EBS region

2.  computed the mean value of body mass (weight) for each cm length bin
    over all areas and time

3.  divided each weight measurement by that mean cm-specific value (the
    "standardization" step)

4.  plotted these standardized values by different areas, years, months
    etc. to evaluate condition differences (pooling over ages is
    effective as there were no size-specific biases apparent)

In the first instance, the overarching seasonal pattern in body mass
relative to the mean shows that as the winter progresses prior to peak
spawning, pollock are generally skinnier than average whereas in July,
the median is about average (Fig. \ref{fig:fsh_lw_month}). As the
summer/fall progresses, fish were at their heaviest given length (Fig.
\ref{fig:fsh_lw_month}). This is also apparent when the data are
aggregated by A- and B-seasons (and by east and west of 170$^\circ$W;
referred to as SE and NW respectively) when plotted over time (Fig.
\ref{fig:fsh_lw_anom_str_yr_box}, where stratum 1 = A season, stratum 2
= B season SE, and stratum 3 = B season NW). 
Combining across seasons, the fishery data shows that recent years were below
average weight given length (Fig. \ref{fig:fsh_lw_anom_yr_box}; note
that the anomalies are based on the period 1991-2022).

Examining the weight-at-age, there are also patterns of variability that
vary due to environmental conditions in addition to spatial and temporal
patterns of the fishery. Based on the bootstrap distributions and large
sample sizes, the within-year sampling variability for pollock is small.
However, the between-year variability in mean weights-at-age is
relatively high (Table \ref{tab:wtage}). The coefficients of variation
between years are on the order of 6% to 9% (for the ages that are
targeted) whereas the sampling variability is generally around 1% or 2%.
The approach to account for the identified mean weight-at-age having
clear year and cohort effects was continued (e.g., Fig.
\ref{fig:fsh_wtage_comb}). Details were provided in appendix 1A of
Ianelli et al. (2016). The results from this method showed the relative
variability between years and cohorts and provide estimates for
`r paste0(thisyr,"--",thisyr+2)` (Table \ref{tab:wtage}). How these
fishery weights-at-age estimates can be supplemented using survey
weights-at-age is further illustrated in Fig.
\ref{fig:fish_wtage_data_pred}.

In the 2020 and 2021 fishery, the average weight-at-age for ages 6-8 (the
2012-2014 year classes) was below the time series average. These cohorts
have fluctuated around their means in recent years (Fig.
\ref{fig:fsh_wtage_comb}). To examine this more closely, we split the
bootstrap results into area-season strata and were able to get an
overall picture of the pattern by strata (Fig.
\ref{fig:fsh_wtage_strata} and Fig. \ref{fig:fsh_wtage_strata_yr}). This
showed that the mean weight-at-age is higher in the the B-season in the
area east of 170$^\circ$W compared to the A-season and B-season in the
area west of 170$^\circ$W.

## Parameters estimated within the assessment model

For the selected model, `r M$npar` parameters were estimated conditioned
on data and model assumptions. Initial age composition, subsequent
recruitment, and stock- recruitment parameters account for 79
parameters. This includes vectors describing the initial age composition
(and deviation from the equilibrium expectation) in the first year (as
ages 2--15 in 1964) and the recruitment mean and deviations (at age 1)
from 1964--`r thisyr` and projected recruitment variability (using the
variance of past recruitments) for five years
(`r paste0(nextyr,"--",nextyr+5)`). The two- parameter stock-recruitment
curve is included in addition to a term that allows the average
recruitment before 1964 (that comprises the initial age composition in
that year) to have a mean value different from subsequent years. Note
that the stock-recruit relationship is fit only to stock and recruitment
estimates from 1979 year-class through to the `r thisyr-2` year-class.

Fishing mortality is parameterized to be semi-separable with year and
age (selectivity) components. The age component is allowed to vary over
time; changes are allowed in each year. The mean value of the age
component is constrained to equal one and the last 5 age groups (ages
11--15) are specified to be equal. This latter specification feature is
intended to reduce the number of parameters while acknowledging that
pollock in this age-range are likely to exhibit similar life-history
characteristics (i.e., unlikely to change their relative availability to
the fishery with age). The annual components of fishing mortality result
in `r n<-thisyr-1963` `r n` parameters and the age-time selectivity
schedule forms a 10x`r paste0(n," matrix of ",10*n)` parameters bringing
the total fishing mortality parameters to `r n+n*10`. The rationale for
including time- varying selectivity has recently been supported as a
means to improve retrospective patterns (Szuwalski et al. 2017) and as
best practice (Martell and Stewart, 2013).

For surveys and indices, the treatment of the catchability coefficient,
and interactions with age-specific selectivity require consideration.
For the BTS index, selectivity-at-age is estimated with a logistic curve
in which year specific deviations in the parameters is allowed. Such
time-varying survey selectivity is estimated to account for changes in
the availability of pollock to the survey gear and is constrained by
pre-specified variance terms. Presently, these variance terms have been
set based on balancing input data-based variances and are somewhat
subjective. For the AT survey, which originally began in 1979 (the
current series including data down to 0.5 m from bottom begins in 1994),
optional parameters to allow for age and time-varying patterns exist but
for this assessment and other recent assessments, ATS selectivity is
constant over time. Overall, four catchability coefficients were
estimated: one each for the early fishery catch-per-unit effort (CPUE)
data (from Low and Ikeda, 1980), the VAST combined bottom trawl survey index,
the AT survey data, and the AVO data.
An uninformative prior distribution is used for all of the indices. The
selectivity parameters for the 2 main indices (BTS and ATS) total 135 (the CPUE and
AVO data mirror the fishery and AT survey selectivities, respectively).

Additional fishing mortality rates used for recommending harvest levels
are estimated conditionally on other outputs from the model. For
example, the values corresponding to the $F_{40\%}$ $F_{35\%}$ and
$F_{MSY}$ harvest rates are found by satisfying the constraint that,
given age-specific population parameters (e.g., selectivity, maturity,
mortality, weight-at-age), unique values exist that correspond to these
fishing mortality rates. The likelihood components that are used to fit
the model can be categorized as:

-   Total catch biomass (log-normal, $\sigma=0.05$)
-   Log-normal indices of pollock biomass; bottom trawl surveys assume
    annual estimates of sampling error, as represented in Fig.
    \ref{fig:bts_biom} along with the covariance matrices (for the
    density-dependent and VAST index series); for the AT index the
    annual errors were specified to have a mean CV of 0.20; while for
    the AVO data, a value relative to the AT index was estimated and
    scaled to have a mean CV of 0.3).
-   Fishery and survey proportions-at-age estimates (multinomial with
    effective sample sizes presented Table \ref{tab:input_n}).
-   Age 1 index from the AT survey (CV set equal to 30% as in prior
    assessments).\
-   Selectivity constraints: penalties/priors on age-age variability,
    time changes, and decreasing (with age) patterns.
-   Stock-recruitment: penalties/priors involved with fitting a
    stochastic stock-recruitment relationship within the integrated
    model.
-   "Fixed effects" terms accounting for cohort and year sources of
    variability in fishery mean weights-at-age estimated based on
    available data from 1991-`r lastyr` from the fishery (and
    1982-`r thisyr` for the bottom-trawl survey data) and externally
    estimated variance terms as described in Appendix 1A of Ianelli et
    al. (2016; see Fig. \ref{fig:fish_wtage_data_pred}).

Work evaluating temperature and predation-dependent effects on the stock-
recruitment estimates continues (Spencer et al. 2016). This approach modified
the estimation of the stock-recruitment relationship by including the effect of
temperature and predation mortality. A relationship between recruitment
residuals and temperature was noted(similar to that found in Mueter et al.,
2011 and subsequently noted in Thorson et al., 2020a) and lower pollock
recruitment during warmer conditions might be expected. Similar results
relating summer temperature conditions to subsequent pollock recruitment for
recent years were also found by Yasumiishi et al. (2015) where research
suggests that summer warmth is associated with earlier diapause of copepods
(Thorson et al., 2020b), such that a fall (but not spring) survey of copepod
densities is also associated with cold conditions and elevated recruitment
(Eisner et al., 2020).

# Results

## Model evaluation

A sequential sensitivity of available new data showed that adding the
2021 fishery catch-at-age data and the 2022 catch biomass information
increased the spawning biomass estimates (Fig.
\ref{fig:mod_data}). Adding the new 2022 bottom-trawl survey estimates
increased the spawning biomass estimate 
further,  as did adding in this years acoustic-trawl survey data
and AVO data (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_data}). 
Diagnostics of model fits between the set
evaluated are given in Table \ref{tab:mod_fits} and comparisons of
management quantities are given in Table \ref{tab:mgt_quants}).

For setting advice, we selected the same Model 20 from the 2020 assessment. Borrowing
an estimate of _M_ from the Bogoslof assessment (this volume) as a prior increased
the value slightly but results were similar. Additionally, we updated the 
statistical weighting of composition data (the relative weights had been tuned last in 2016). This
model had very little impact on the results (Table \ref{tab:mod_fits}).

In the 2020 assessment, SRR evaluations related to Tier 1 classification
showed that dropping the influence of the 1978 year-class in the
estimation lowered the steepness of the curve and that when the
influence of the prior distribution was removed the residual pattern for
estimates near the origin was particularly bad (all below the curve).
From those results we conclude that the prior specification was
appropriate because we place priority on fitting estimated recruits near
the slope at the origin better. Last year's assessment also showed that
conditioning the SRR to fit the condition of having the "actual"
$F_{MSY}$ equal some $F_{MSY}$ proxies (e.g., equal $F_{35\%}$) shows
that the results were more conservative (shallower initial slopes). A
conclusion from these exercises was that the SPR proxy for $F_{MSY}$
implies a reasonable "shape" to the SRR.

The fit to the early Japanese fishery CPUE data (Low and Ikeda 1980) was
consistent with the estimated population trends for this period (Fig.
\ref{fig:mod_cpue_fit}). The model fits the fishery-independent index
from the 2006--2021 AVO data well through most of the period but the
model predicts lower biomass than the index data indicate in 2021 (Fig.
\ref{fig:mod_avo_fit}). The model fits to the bottom-trawl survey
biomass (the density-dependent corrected series) were reasonable and
within the observation error bounds (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_bts_biom}). 
The model fit to the BTS biomass index predicts
fewer pollock than observed in the 2014 and 2015 survey but then varied
in subsequent years (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_bts_biom}). 
The fit to the acoustic-trawl survey biomass series (including the USV data
from 2020) was consistent with the specified observation uncertainty
(Fig. \ref{fig:mod_ats_biom}).

The estimated parameters and standard errors are provided
[online](https://apps-afsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/Plan_Team/2022/EBSPollock_params.pdf).
The code for the model (with dimensions and links to parameter names)
and input files are available on request.

The input sample size (as tuned in 2016 using "Francis Weights") can be
evaluated visually for consistency with expectations of mean annual age
for the different gear types (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_mean_age}; Francis
2011). The estimated selectivity pattern changes over time and reflects
to some degree the extent to which the fishery is focused on
particularly prominent year-classes (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_fsh_sel}). The
model fits the fishery age-composition data quite well under this form
of selectivity (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_fsh_age}).

Bottom-trawl survey selectivity estimates are shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:mod_bts_sel}. 
The pattern of bottom
trawl survey age composition data in recent years shows a decline in the
abundance of age 10+ pollock since 2011 (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_bts_age}). Through the time series of the
available data, the model predicted proportions of the 2012 and 2013
year classes varied in terms of under- and over- estimates as the 2013
year-class became more common in the data (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_bts_age}).
The AT age compositions consistently track large year classes through
the population and the model fits these patterns reasonably well (Fig.
\ref{fig:mod_ats_age}).

As in past assessments, we evaluated the multivariate posterior
distribution using Monte-Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) simulation methods.
This year we adopted the no-uturn sampling approach from ADMB but upgraded
and packaged within R (adnuts, Monnahan 2019). This allowed thorough sampling
diagnostics and was able to sample the posterior efficiently within a few hours 
(or less). This new package also demonstrated that the asymptotic parameter
standard deviations were reasonable approximations of the marginal densities
from the integrated posterior distribution (Fig. \ref{fig:MLE_v_post}). 
As before, we evaluated how selected parameters
relate by doing a pairwise (along with their marginal distributions;
Fig. \ref{fig:mcmc_pairs}). This illustrates how key parameters
relate to management parameters of interest. For example, the stock
recruitment steepness is negatively correlated to the resulting
$B_{MSY}$ estimate. We also compare the point estimates (highest
posterior density) with the mean of the posterior marginal distribution
of the `r thisyr` spawning biomass. This showed that the point estimate
was similar to the mean of the marginal posterior distribution (Fig.
\ref{fig:mcmc_marg}). As an additional part of the Tier 1 consideration,
we evaluated the posterior density of $F_{MSY}$ and is provided in Fig.
\ref{fig:mcmc_marg_fmsy} for reference.

Progress on developing  methods for estimating random-effect variances 
within the model has been slow. We  added code for
producing posterior predictive distributions (e.g., for
the two acoustic indices in Fig. \ref{fig:acoustic_ppl}. Additionally, we
developed some preliminary diagnostics to evaluate how the model's posterior
components affect key parameters of interest. For example, it is useful
to know the relative impact of the 2018 year-class on the next year's spawning
biomass (Fig. \ref{fig:ssb_v_2018}). Additionally, what different components
(in negative log-likelihood terms) conflict or interact with such a critical
parameter (Fig. \ref{fig:post_profile})

### Retrospective analysis

Running the assessment model over a grid with progressively fewer years
included (going back to 10 years, i.e., assuming the data extent ended
in `r thisyr-10`) results in a fair amount of variability in spawning
biomass (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_retro}). Last year with the lower than
expected survey biomass estimate followed by an increase this year, the
retrospective pattern degraded with an
average bias (Mohns $\rho$ equal to
`r round(rhoMohn10,3)` for the 10 year retrospective).

For the recruitment side, the retrospective pattern shows two key
results. First, the 2018 year-class (age 1 recruits in 2019) shows up as
a big estimate just this year (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_retroR}). Second, the 
retrospective pattern shows how an equally abundant year-class occurred 
from the 2012 year-class for three years (with data terminating in 2016, 2017,
and 2018). Then, in 2019 and in subsequent years that estimate dropped by over 
10% and became the 2012 _and_ the 2013 year-class. For this reason, we
considered it reasonable to adjust the 2018 year-class to be similar to what
appears to occur in subsequent years when more data become available.


In response to previous SSC requests to evaluate how selectivity is used for
ABC and catch advice, we used the retrospective runs to show how the
"projected" selectivity compared with subsequent estimates which had the
benefit of more data (Fig. \ref{fig:retro_sel}). To explain this figure,
and taking the 2022 panel as an example, the blue line in that panel
represents the projected estimate from the 2021 "peel" (the current
model projecting to 2022 using only data up until 2021). The dots
represent estimates from each "peel" and the dots in the 2022 panel are
based on this year's estimated selectivity. In general, the projected
selectivity conformed reasonably well with subsequent estimates. To
further summarize these results, we also computed a summary statistic as
the mean age of selection (independent of any age-specific stock size):

$\bar a =\frac{\sum{S_a a}}{\sum{S_a}}$

where $S_a$ is the selectivity at age (ages 1 to 11). This statistic
showed that recently the projection was biased towards younger pollock
but earlier on, the bias was toward older fish (Fig.
\ref{fig:retro_sel_mnage}).

Since selectivity varies over time, and the fact that fishing mortality
rates for management advice depend on the assumed future selectivity, we
evaluate the pattern of $F_{MSY}$ rates given different selectivity
assumptions (i.e., Fig. \ref{fig:mod_fsh_sel}). In the 2020 and 2021 assessment,
because of the indications of small pollock being unusually present in
the fishery, we chose a selectivity pattern from history that reflected
tendency towards younger fish (specifically, that from 2005). Using the
statistic on mean selected age, we found that the corresponding
$F_{MSY}$ showed a correlation (Fig. \ref{fig:fmsy_sel}). This figure
reveals how shifts in the relative age of fish selected impact $F_{MSY}$
estimates.

## Time series results

The time series of begin-year biomass estimates (ages 3 and older)
suggests that the abundance of Eastern Bering Sea pollock remained at a
high level from 1982--88, with estimates ranging from 8 to 12 million t
(Table \ref{tab:biom_3plus}). Historically, biomass levels increased
from 1979 to the mid-1980s due to the strong 1978 and relatively strong
1982 and 1984 year classes recruiting to the fishable population. The
stock is characterized by peaks in the mid-1980s, the mid-1990s and
again appears to be increasing to a peak of more than 12 million t in 2016
following the low in 2008 of `r round(M$age3plus[45]/1000,2)` million t.
The estimate for `r thisyr` is trending downward and at
`r round(M$age3plus[length(M$age3plus)]/1000,2)` million t with
`r nextyr` estimated at `r round(M$age3plus1/1000,2)` million t.

The level of fishing relative to biomass estimates shows that the
spawning exploitation rate (SER, defined as the percent removal of egg
production in each spawning year) has been mostly below 20% since 1980
(Fig. \ref{fig:mod_ser}). During 2006 and 2007 the rate averaged more
than 20% and the average fishing mortality increased during the period
of stock decline. The estimate for 2009 through 2018 was below 20% due
to the reductions in TACs relative to the maximum permissible ABC values
and increases in the spawning biomass. The fishing mortality has
fluctuated since 2010-2015 but, unlike last year's upward trend, the improved
spawning biomass condition has held this rate tending toward lower levels.
Age specific fishing mortality rates
reflect these patterns and show some increases in the oldest ages from
2011--2013 but relatively stable (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_F}). The
estimates of age 3+ pollock biomass showed a large drop last year
compared to several of the earlier years but this has reversed in the
current assessment (Fig. \ref {fig:mod_hist}, Table \ref{tab:biom_3plus}).

Estimated numbers-at-age are presented in (Table \ref{tab:est_n}) and
estimated catch-at-age values are presented in (Table
\ref{tab:est_catage}). Estimated summary biomass (age 3+), female
spawning biomass, and age-1 recruitment are given in (Table
\ref{tab:biom_ssb_rec}).

To evaluate past management and assessment performance it can be useful
to examine estimated fishing mortality relative to reference values. For
EBS pollock, we computed the reference fishing mortality from Tier 1
(unadjusted) and recalculated the historical values for $F_{MSY}$ (since
selectivity has changed over time). Since 1977 the current estimates of
fishing mortality suggest that during the early period, harvest rates
were above $F_{MSY}$ until about 1980. Since that time, the levels of
fishing mortality have averaged about 35% of the $F_{MSY}$ level (Fig.
\ref{fig:mod_phase}). Projections of spawning stock biomass given the
`r thisyr+1` estimate of fishing mortality rate given catches equal to
the `r thisyr` values shows a decline through 2021 and then an increase
after; albeit with considerable uncertainty due to uncertainty in
recruitment (Fig. \ref{fig:proj_ssb}).

### Recruitment

Model estimates indicate that the 2008, 2012, 2013, and now the 2018
year classes are above average (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_rec}). The 2018 year class
is nearly 4 times bigger than average with a CV of about 16%. 
The stock-recruitment curve as fit within the integrated model 
shows the variability of the estimated
curve (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_srr}). Note that the 2020 and 2021 year classes
(as age 1 recruits in 2021 and 2022) were excluded from the
stock-recruitment curve estimation. Separate from fitting the stock-
recruit relationship within the model, examining the estimated
recruits-per-spawning biomass shows variability over time but seems to
lack trend and also is consistent with the Ricker stock- recruit
relationship used within the model (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_rs}).

Environmental factors affecting recruitment are considered important and
contribute to the variability. Previous studies linked strong Bering Sea
pollock recruitment to years with warm sea temperatures and northward
transport of pollock eggs and larvae (Wespestad et al. 2000; Mueter et
al. 2006). As part of the Bering-Aleutian Salmon International Survey
(BASIS) project research has also been directed toward the relative
density and quality (in terms of condition for survival) of
young-of-year pollock. For example, Moss et al. (2009) found age-0
pollock were very abundant and widely distributed to the north and east
on the Bering Sea shelf during 2004 and 2005 (warm sea temperature; high
water column stratification) indicating high northern transport of
pollock eggs and larvae during those years. Mueter et al. (2011) found
that warmer conditions tended to result in lower pollock recruitment in
the EBS. This is consistent with the hypothesis that when sea
temperatures on the eastern Bering Sea shelf are warm and the water
column is highly stratified during summer, age-0 pollock appear to
allocate more energy to growth than to lipid storage (presumably due to
a higher metabolic rate), leading to low energy density prior to winter.
This then may result in increased over-winter mortality (Swartzman et
al. 2005, Winter et al. 2005). Ianelli et al. (2011) evaluated the
consequences of current harvest policies in the face of warmer
conditions with the link to potentially lower pollock recruitment and
noted that the current management system is likely to face higher
chances of ABCs below the historical average catches. Also, as part of
the evaluation of stationarity given periods of "regimes", we revisited
estimated mean recruitment during different periods previously
identified as being unique (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_regimes}). This shows that given
the revised estimate of the  2018 year class, the impact of the recent
warm conditions suggest that the recent period (2000-present) is similar to the
mean since 1977.

# Harvest recommendations

## Status summary

The estimate of $B_{MSY}$ is `r M$bmsys` kt (with a CV of
`r round(100*(M$bmsy.sd/M$bmsy),0)`%) which is
`r if(M$bmsy<M$nextyrssb) {"less"}else{"more"}` than the projected
`r nextyr` spawning biomass of `r M$nextyrssbs` kt; (Table
\ref{tab:res_summ}). For `r thisyr+1`, the estimates put the stock in
Tier 1`r if(M$bmsy<M$curssb) {"a"}else{"b"}`. The corresponding maximum
permissible ABC would thus be `r M$maxabc1s` t with a fishable biomass
estimated at around `r M$ABC_biom1s` kt (Table \ref{tab:tier1_proj}).
For the current year spawning biomass this corresponds to
`r round(M$curssb/M$bmsy*100,0)`% of the $B_{MSY}$ level. A diagnostic
(see the EBS Pollock Model Description appendix below) on the impact of
fishing shows that the `r thisyr` spawning stock size is about
`r round(100*M$dynb0,0)`% of the predicted value had no fishing occurred
since 1978 (Table \ref{tab:res_summ}).

Noting the relatively high uncertainty in the estimated 2018 year class, 
we developed an alternative Tier 3 projection.  We specified the age 4 numbers at age in 
2022 to be equal to the average of the 2012 and 2013 year classes (at age 4). The
rationale was that these were recent and well above-average estimates. Although
the signs for a large 2018 year class are positive, given the uncertainty in the 
estimate it seemed prudent to lower the expectation that that year-class is the most 
abundant ever.  Lowering this expection slightly  still  resulted in 
optimistic near-term conditions and suggests 
that the spawning biomass in `r nextyr` will be 
about `r round(100*M$curssb/M$b100,0)`% of $B_{100\%}$. 
These values are based on the usual SPR expansion using mean 
1978--`r thisyr -2` recruitment. This would put the stock in Tier
3`r if(M$curssb>(M$b100*.4)) {"a and above"}else{"b and below"}`
$B_{40\%}$ and result in a `r paste(thisyr,"ABC of",M$Tier3_ABC1s,"t")`. 
The Tier 3 run with the 2018 year-class (as age 4-yr olds) from the unadjusted
projection configuration increased the ABC to `r Tier3_abc_fulls` t 
(and 2,275,000 for 2024); a difference of 
`r paste0(round(Tier3_abc_full-M$Tier3_ABC1,0),",000")` t. This alternative
was provided and represents a `r paste0(round(100*(1-M$Tier3_ABC1/Tier3_abc_full),0),"%")  `
decline from the unadjusted projection configuration.

The probability that the current stock size is below 20% of $B_{0}$ (a
level important for additional management measures related to Steller
sea lion recovery) is \<0.1% for `r thisyr+1` and `r nextyr+1`.

In response to a request from the SSC, we added results from
projections based on Tier 2. We report the "standard" Tier 2 ABC
calculation using the point estimate (the mean of the posterior
distribution) of $F_{MSY}$. Therefore, for `r nextyr` the Tier
2`r if(M$bmsy<M$curssb) {"a"}else{"b"}` ABC would be `r M$Tier2_ABC1s`
t. Since we have estimates of the harmonic mean (from Tier 1
calculations) an alternative Tier 2 estimate using that in place of the
arithmetic mean $F_{MSY}$ results in an ABC of `r M$Tier1.5_ABC1s` t.

In summary, the criterion for Tier 1 depends on a reliable estimate of
$F_{MSY}$ and the uncertainty (the PDF). Tier 2 also requires a reliable
estimate of $F_{MSY}$ (without the PDF requirement). Given the seemingly
reasonable posterior marginal density for $F_{MSY}$, it seems if Tier 1
criterion is unmet, then so would the requirement for Tier 2. Adopting
Tier 3, while in principle may result in more conservative catch advice,
uses less information available about the stock productivity and
requires adopting more assumptions (i.e., that $F_{35\%}$ is a
reasonable proxy for $F_{MSY}$). As noted below in the section on risk
evaluations, there are reasons for increased concerns. However, these
seem to be unrelated to overall stock productivity as relates to the SRR
and estimates of $F_{MSY}$. Consequently, our overall analysis continues to 
support the SSC's classification of this stock to be within Tier 1.


## Amendment 56 Reference Points

Amendment 56 to the BSAI Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP)
defines overfishing level (OFL), the fishing mortality rate used to set
OFL (FOFL), the maximum permissible ABC, and the fishing mortality rate
used to set the maximum permissible ABC. The fishing mortality rate used
to set ABC ($F_{ABC}$) may be less than this maximum permissible level,
but not greater. Estimates of reference points related to maximum
sustainable yield (MSY) are currently available. However, we present
both reference points for pollock in the BSAI to retain the option for
consideration of either Tier 1, 2, or Tier 3 values from the harvest
control rules provided in Amendment 56. These Tiers require reference
point estimates for biomass level determinations. Consistent with other
groundfish stocks, the following values are based on recruitment
estimates from post-1976 spawning events (recognizing the the 1978 year
class is excluded from the MSY calculations but included in the SPR
calculations):

```{=tex}
\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{tabular}{lr}
$B_{MSY}$    &= `r M$bmsys` kt female spawning biomass    \\
$B_{0}$      &= `r M$b0s` kt female spawning biomass    \\
$B_{100\%}$  &= `r M$b100s` kt female spawning biomass   \\
$B_{40\%}$   &= `r M$b40s` kt female spawning biomass    \\
$B_{35\%}$   &= `r M$b35s` kt female spawning biomass    \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
```
## Specification of OFL and Maximum Permissible ABC

Under Amendment 56 of the [BSAI Groundfish
FMP](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjv3vTxvon0AhV1JTQIHYPrBbUQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npfmc.org%2Fwp-content%2FPDFdocuments%2Ffmp%2FBSAI%2FBSAIfmp.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0a9uMI-1r3Ylt4jQf1qImj),
the SSC qualified this stock as satisfying the Tier 1 conditions. As
such, the harmonic mean value of $F_{MSY}$ ---here computed as an
exploitation rate---is applied to the fishable biomass for computing ABC
levels. For details on the risk-averse properties of this approach see
Thompson (1996). For a future year, the fishable biomass is defined as
the sum over ages of predicted begin-year numbers multiplied by age
specific fishery selectivity and estimated mean body mass-at-age. The
uncertainty in the average weights-at-age projected for the fishery and
"future selectivity" has been demonstrated to affect the buffer between
ABC and OFL (computed as 1-ABC/OFL) for Tier 1 maximum permissible ABC
(Ianelli et al. 2015). The uncertainty in future mean weights-at-age had
a relatively large impact as did the selectivity estimation (see the
section above on retrospective behavior and Fig. \ref{fig:fmsy_sel}).

Since the `r nextyr` female spawning biomass is estimated to be
`r M$bmsystatus` the $B_{MSY}$ level (`r M$bmsys` kt) and
`r M$b40status` the $B_{40\%}$ value (`r M$b40s` kt) in `r nextyr` and
if the `r thisyr` catch is as specified above, then the OFL and maximum
permissible ABC values by the different Tier categorizations would be:

```{r abctab13}
df <- data.table(Tier=c(M$tier1ab1,
                        M$tier1ab2,

print(tab,floating=FALSE,include.rownames=F,big.mark=",",hline.after=c(-1,0,2,4,nrow(tab)))
```

Note that the values presented for 2023 assumed a catch of 1,111,000 t
in 2022.

## Standard Harvest Scenarios and Projection Methodology

A standard set of projections is required for each stock managed under
Tiers 1, 2, or 3 of Amendment 56 to the FMP. This set of projections
encompasses seven harvest scenarios designed to satisfy the requirements
of Amendment 56, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA). While
EBS pollock is generally considered to fall within Tier 1, the standard
projection model requires knowledge of future uncertainty in $F_{MSY}$ .
Since this would require a number of additional assumptions that presume
future knowledge about stock-recruit uncertainty, the projections in
this subsection are based on Tier 3.

For each scenario, the projections begin with the vector of `r thisyr`
numbers at age estimated in the assessment. This vector is then
projected forward to the beginning of `r nextyr` using the schedules of
natural mortality and selectivity described in the assessment and the
best available estimate of total (year-end) catch assumed for
`r thisyr`. In each subsequent year, the fishing mortality rate is
prescribed on the basis of the spawning biomass in that year and the
respective harvest scenario. Annual recruits are simulated from an
inverse Gaussian distribution whose parameters consist of maximum
likelihood estimates determined from the estimated age-1 recruits.
Spawning biomass is computed in each year based on the time of peak
spawning and the maturity and weight schedules described in the
assessment. Total catch is assumed to equal the catch associated with
the respective harvest scenario in all years. This projection scheme is
run 1,000 times to obtain distributions of possible future stock sizes
and catches under alternative fishing mortality rate scenarios.

Five of the seven standard scenarios will be used in an Environmental
Assessment prepared in conjunction with the final SAFE. These five
scenarios, which are designed to provide a range of harvest alternatives
that are likely to bracket the final TAC for `r nextyr`, are as follows
("$maxFABC$" refers to the maximum permissible value of FABC under
Amendment 56):

```{=tex}
\begin{description}
\item[Scenario 1:]   
In all future years, $F$ is set equal to max$F_{ABC}$. (Rationale:  Historically,
TAC has been constrained by ABC, so this scenario provides a likely upper
limit on future TACs).

\item[Scenario 2:]   
In `r nextyr` and `r nextyr+1` the catch is set equal to 1.30 million t
and in future years $F$ is set equal to the Tier 3 estimate (Rationale: this 
has been about equal to the catch level in recent years).

\item[Scenario 3:]   
In all future years, $F$ is set equal to the `r thisyr-6;print("-");thisyr-1` average $F$. (Rationale:
For some stocks, TAC can be well below ABC, and recent average $F$ may provide a
better indicator of $F_{TAC}$ than $F_{ABC}$.)

\item[Scenario 4:]   
In all future years, $F$ is set equal to $F_{60\%}$. (Rationale:  This
scenario provides a likely lower bound on $F_{ABC}$ that still allows future
harvest rates to be adjusted downward when stocks fall below reference levels.

\item[Scenario 5:]   
In all future years, $F$ is set equal to zero. (Rationale:  In
extreme cases, TAC may be set at a level close to zero.)

\item[Scenario 6:]   
In all future years, F is set equal to $F_{OFL}$. (Rationale:  This scenario
determines whether a stock is overfished. If the stock is expected to be 
1) below its MSY level in `r thisyr` or 2) below half of its MSY level in `r thisyr` or below
its MSY level in `r thisyr +10` under this scenario, then the stock is overfished.)

\item[Scenario 7:]   
In `r nextyr` and `r nextyr+1`, F is set equal to $maxFABC$, and in all subsequent years, F
is set equal to $F_{OFL}$. (Rationale:  This scenario determines whether a stock is
approaching an overfished condition. If the stock is 1) below its MSY level in
`r nextyr+1` or 2) below 1/2 of its MSY level in `r nextyr+1` and expected to be below its MSY
level in `r thisyr+12` under this scenario, then the stock is approaching an
overfished condition).

\end{description}
```
The latter two scenarios are needed to satisfy the MSFCMA's requirement
to determine whether a stock is currently in an overfished condition or
is approaching an overfished condition (for Tier 3 stocks, the MSY level
is defined as $B_{35\%}$).

## Projections and status determination

For the purposes of these projections, we present results based on
selecting the $F_{40\%}$ harvest rate as the $F_{ABC}$ value and use
$F_{35\%}$ as a proxy for $F_{MSY}$. Scenarios 1 through 7 were
projected 14 years from `r thisyr` (Table \ref{tab:tier3_SSB} for Model
20.0--including the 1978 year-class as is convention for Tier 3
estimates). Under catches set to Tier 3 ABC estimates, the expected
spawning biomass is well above $B_{35\%}$ and is expected to be
drop below $B_{40\%}$ by 2026 (given mean recruitment; Fig.
\ref{fig:tier3_proj} and assuming catches >2 million t in 2025).

Any stock that is below its minimum stock size threshold (MSST) is
defined to be overfished. Any stock that is expected to fall below its
MSST in the next two years is defined to be approaching an overfished
condition. Harvest scenarios 6 and 7 are used in these determinations as
follows:

Is the stock overfished? This depends on the stock's estimated spawning
biomass in `r thisyr`:

-   If spawning biomass for `r thisyr` is estimated to be below 1/2
    $B_{35\%}$ the stock is below its MSST.

-   If spawning biomass for `r thisyr` is estimated to be above
    $B_{35\%}$, the stock is above its MSST.

-   If spawning biomass for `r thisyr` is estimated to be above 1/2
    $B_{35\%}$ but below $B_{35\%}$, the stock's status relative to MSST
    is determined by referring to harvest scenario 6 (Tables
    \ref{tab:tier3_C} through \ref{tab:tier3_SSB}). If the mean spawning
    biomass for `r thisyr + 10` is below $B_{35\%}$, the stock is below
    its MSST. Otherwise, the stock is above its MSST.

Is the stock approaching an overfished condition? This is determined by
referring to harvest Scenario 7:

-   If the mean spawning biomass for `r thisyr` is below 1/2 $B_{35\%}$,
    the stock is approaching an overfished condition.

-   If the mean spawning biomass for `r thisyr` is above $B_{35\%}$, the
    stock is not approaching an overfished condition.

-   If the mean spawning biomass for `r nextyr+1` is above 1/2
    $B_{35\%}$ but below $B_{35\%}$, the determination depends on the
    mean spawning biomass for `r nextyr+11`. If the mean spawning
    biomass for `r nextyr+11` is below $B_{35\%}$, the stock is
    approaching an overfished condition. Otherwise, the stock is not
    approaching an overfished condition.

For scenarios 6 and 7, we conclude that pollock is above MSST for the
year `r thisyr`, and it is expected to be above the "overfished
condition" based on Scenario 7 (the mean spawning biomass in `r thisyr`
is between the 1/2 $B_{35\%}$ and $B_{35\%}$ estimate but by
`r nextyr+11` the stock is above $B_{35\%}$; (Table
\ref{tab:tier3_SSB}). Based on this, the EBS pollock stock is being
fished below the overfishing level and is not approaching an overfished
condition.

To fulfill reporting requirements for [NOAA's Species Information
System](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/data/species-information-system),
we computed the fishing mortality rate corresponding to the specified
OFL for the last complete year (`r thisyr-1`). This hypothetical
`r thisyr-1` $F_{OFL}$ from this year's model was estimated to be 0.5431
for EBS pollock (assuming this year's estimated 2022 selectivity and
weight-at-age).

## ABC Recommendation

ABC levels are affected by estimates of $F_{MSY}$ which depend
principally on the estimated stock-recruitment steepness parameter,
demographic schedules such as selectivity-at-age, maturity, and growth.
The current stock size (both spawning and fishable) is estimated to be
`r M$bmsystatus` average levels and projections indicate the potential for further
declines. Updated data and analysis result in an estimate of `r thisyr`
spawning biomass (`r M$curssbs` kt) which is about
`r round(100*M$curssb/M$bmsy,0)`% of $B_{MSY}$ (`r M$bmsys` kt). This
follows a short period of decline from 2017-2020 followed by a previously
unexpected increase due to revised estimates of the 2018 year class. 
Treating all new data the same way as in the past, this estimate suggests
that it would be the biggest year-class on record (`r M$yc2018s` age 1 numbers),
but with considerable  uncertainty.

Given the same estimated aggregate fishing
effort as in 2022 and given the estimated stock trend, the constant-F scenario would yield
about 1.3 million t. To obtain 2023 catches on the order of 1.45 million t, given the base
model estimates, would require about 18% more effort than what was estimated from
2022.

### Should the ABC be reduced below the maximum permissible ABC?

The SSC in its September 2018 minutes recommended that assessment
authors and Plan Teams use the risk table below when determining whether
to recommend an ABC lower than the maximum permissible. The details of
the risk table are provided below. Given the concerns listed there, we recommend reducing the ABC 
to the value provided under Tier 3 projections.

```
The table is applied by evaluating the severity of four types of
considerations that could be used to support a scientific recommendation
to reduce the ABC from the maximum permissible. Examples of the types of
concerns that might be relevant include the following (as identified by
the work-group):

1.  Assessment considerations\

    -   *Data-inputs:* biased ages, skipped surveys, lack of
        fishery-independent trend data\
    -   *Model fits:* poor fits to fits to fishery or survey data,
        inability to simultaneously fit multiple data inputs.\
    -   *Model performance:* poor model convergence, multiple minima in
        the likelihood surface, parameters hitting bounds.\
    -   *Estimation uncertainty:* poorly-estimated but influential year
        classes.\
    -   Retrospective bias in biomass estimates.

2.  Population dynamics considerations---decreasing biomass trend, poor
    recent recruitment, inability of the stock to rebuild, abrupt
    increase or decrease in stock abundance.

3.  Environmental/ecosystem considerations--trends in
    environmental/ecosystem indicators, ecosystem model results,
    decreases in ecosystem productivity, decreases in prey abundance or
    availability, increases or increases in predator abundance or
    productivity.

4.  Fisheries considerations--fishery CPUE is showing a contrasting
    pattern from the stock biomass trend, unusual spatial pattern of
    fishing, changes in the percent of TAC taken, changes in the
    duration of fishery openings."

#### Assessment considerations

The EBS pollock assessment model has appeared to track the stock from
year-to-year based on retrospective analysis in previous assessments.
This year however, there was a substantial increase relative to the
lower than expected survey observation from 2021; this affected 
the retrospective analyses which last year indicated a
tendency to over estimate the stock trend. The model tracks the
available data reasonably well except for the strong increase in the AVO
index relative to the last two years. 
We also recognize that the stock-recruitment
relationship selected for this cannibalistic species requires a
relatively informative prior distribution in order to have the residuals
of the estimates relative to the curve to be less biased nearer the
slope of the origin. This could be interpreted as being undesirable and
having undue influence on the underlying stock productivity (noting that
it has been demonstrated that the prior leads to increased
conservativism). **We therefore rated the assessment-related concern as
level 2, substantially increased concern.**

#### Population dynamics considerations

The age structure of EBS pollock has exhibited some peculiarities over
time. On the positive side, some strong year-classes appear to have
increased in abundance based on the bottom-trawl survey data (e.g., the
1992, 2012, 2013 and 2018 year classes). Conversely, the period from
2000--2007 had relatively poor year-class strengths which resulted in
declines in stock below $\it{B_{msy}}$ and reduced TACs due to lower ABC
values. Given the strong year-class strength from 2018, 
it appears that the mean recruitment since 2000 has
been nearly average but with greater variability than earlier years
(Fig. \ref{fig:mod_regimes}). 
The stock is estimated to be above $\it{B_{msy}}$ at present, and
projections indicate a increases given recent catch levels. 
Recruitment in the near term is well above average but are hightly uncertain.
Additional age-specific aspects of the spawning population indicate that
the stock has increased from a low diversity of ages (for both the
population and the mean age of the spawning stock weighted by spawning
output Fig. \ref{fig:age_diversity}). **We therefore rated the
population-dynamics concern as level 1, Normal: No apparent environmental/ecosystem concerns.**

#### Environmental/Ecosystem considerations

*Environmental processes*
The extended warm phase experienced in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) that began in approximately 2014 largely relaxed to normal conditions over the past year (August 2021 - August 2022). The North Pacific Index (NPI) was positive during 5 out of the last 6 winters, with the exception being the winter of 2018 - 2019. Positive values mean a weak Aleutian Low Pressure System and generally calmer conditions. Sea surface temperature (SST) was within one standard deviation of the long term average and marine heatwaves were relatively weak and short-lived compared to recent years. Estimates of bottom temperature derived from the ROMS model suggest that bottom temperatures in the northern Bering Sea (NBS) over the past year were within normal ranges while the southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS) was significantly cooler than average. The Bering Sea ice extent was generally higher than average throughout much of the 2021-2022 winter. Ice advanced rapidly in November, though there was an abrupt springtime retreat beginning in mid-April (Hennon et al., 2022).  

These cool-to-normal winter conditions were favorable to cold pool formation, though not to the areal extent in the years preceding 2014. The 2022 cold pool was near the historical average and the spatial footprint was similar to the most recent near-average years in 2011 and 2017. North of ~57°C, the cold pool covered nearly the entire middle domain of the survey area between 50-m and 100-m isobaths. The extents of the <= -1°C, <= 0°C, and  <= 1°C isotherms were larger than during the three prior surveys and near their time-series averages (Hennon et al., 2022).  

Age-0 fish experiencing warm temperatures during late summer followed by relatively cooler temperatures in spring of age-1 are thought to have below average survival. Based on this Temperature Change index, the 2018 year class was predicted to have above-average recruitment to age-4 in 2022 (Yasumiishi, 2019) while the 2021 year class is predicted to have average recruitment to age-4 in 2025 (Yasumiishi, 2022). 

The ecosystem ‘red flags’ that occurred in the NBS in 2021, notably the crab population declines (Richar 2021) and salmon run failures in the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim region (Liller 2021), continued into 2022 (Richar 2022; Whitehouse 2022b). 

*Prey*
Spring bloom peak timing suggests that 2022 was average in the south inner, south middle, and south outer shelf regions. For the south middle shelf region, there was evidence of 2 peaks (Nielsen et al., 2022), while chlorophyll-a biomass varied spatially over the shelf. Persistently low chlorophyll-a biomass within the outer shelf region has occurred since 2015 (Nielsen et al., 2022). Depending on the spatial and temporal overlap of productivity, this can result in a match or mismatch with favorable feeding conditions for larval pollock. Additionally, in 2022, the coccolithophore index for both the inner and middle shelf was among the highest ever observed in the timeseries. The striking milky aquamarine color of the water during a coccolithophore bloom can reduce foraging success for visual predators, such as fish and surface-feeding seabirds (Nielsen and Eisner, 2022). 
Small copepods form the prey base for larval to early juvenile pollock during spring. Late juvenile pollock feed on a variety of planktonic crustaceans, including calanoid copepods and euphausiids. Pollock diets become more piscivorous with age and cannibalism is commonly observed. The Rapid Zooplankton Assessment (Kimmel et al., 2022) noted reduced overall zooplankton productivity in the EBS in spring and late- summer 2022, though euphausiid abundances were higher than recent years, supporting the hypothesis that increased euphausiid abundances during warm years may compensate for lower large copepod abundances (Duffy-Anderson et al., 2017). The acoustic euphausiid survey documented an increase in euphausiid density from 2018 (last available estimate), but the 2022 value still remains below the time series average (Ressler, 2022). Over the northern shelf in late summer, small copepods declined by nearly an order of magnitude on average compared to prior years, large copepods were higher than those observed over the southern shelf and greater than those observed in 2018 and 2019, and euphausiid abundances were higher compared to prior years and have increased every year since 2018 (Kimmel et al., 2022). 

A significant relationship exists between the abundance of large, lipid-rich copepods and the recruitment and survival of juvenile pollock to age-3 (Eisner et al., 2020). Low availability of large copepod prey in 2019 and 2020 may have resulted in reduced overwinter survival and recruitment to age-3 (in 2022 and 2023). That said, in 2018 there was an increase in euphausiids in BASIS age-0 pollock diets (Andrews et al., 2019), which may have mitigated the lack of large copepods, and enhanced overwinter survival and subsequent recruitment of the 2018 year class (Yasumiishi et al., 2022b).

Fish condition, as measured by length-weight residuals, varied between juvenile (100 - 250 mm) and adult (>250 mm) pollock. In the southern Bering Sea, juvenile pollock had above-average condition in 2022, continuing a trend of positive condition anomalies since 2016. Conversely, adult pollock had below-average condition, which has also been the case since 2015 (except 2019 when adult pollock had a positive condition anomaly). In the northern Bering Sea, both juvenile and adult pollock had slightly below-average condition, though the mean for both groups fell within one standard deviation of the historical mean (Rohan et al., 2022).

*Competitors*
Jellyfish feed primarily on zooplankton and small fish, and therefore may compete for prey resources for both juvenile and adult life stages of pollock. Trends in jellyfish abundance (Yasumiishi et al., 2022c)  track those of forage fish (Yasumiishi et al., 2022d), and specifically age-0 pollock (Andrews et al., 2022). The 2022 Bristol Bay sockeye salmon inshore run was the largest on record since 1963 (Cunningham et al., 2022). Juvenile sockeye salmon feed on zooplankton (competitors with age-0 pollock) and age-0 pollock (competitors with adult pollock) in warm years; adults feed on zooplankton and krill. Western Alaska salmon runs, however, have experienced a precipitous and concurrent decline in recent years, leading to potential reduced competition for prey resources where these stocks overlap (Liller, 2021; Whitehouse, 2022). The biomass of pelagic foragers measured during the standard EBS bottom trawl survey increased sharply from 2021 to 2022, up more than 70%. The guild is largely driven by trends in pollock, although it is worth noting that Pacific herring were up more than 200% from 2021, well above their long-term mean (Whitehouse, 2022). The impacts of recent large year classes of sablefish to the EBS ecosystem (as prey, predators, and competitors) remains largely unknown at this time. The large 2019 year class of sablefish (see Goethel et al. 2021) may compete with pollock for prey resources as juveniles.

*Predators*
Pollock are cannibalistic and rates of cannibalism might be expected to increase as the biomass of older, larger fish increases. In 2022, with an average cold pool extent over the shelf, predation pressure from cannibalism may have been mitigated by this thermal barrier as adult pollock tend to avoid the cold bottom waters. In 2021, a small retracted cold pool likely offered no thermal refuge or barrier for juvenile pollock. However, the biomass of pelagic foragers, including adult pollock dropped in 2021 to their second lowest value over the time series (Whitehouse, 2021). Fur seal consumption of adult pollock generally increases in years when juvenile pollock are less abundant (Kuhn et al., 2019). However, Northern fur seal pup production at St. Paul Island in 2021 continued a declining trend since 1998 that may be partially attributed to low pup growth rates (see 2022 Report Card in Siddon, 2022).
Other potential predators of juvenile pollock include jellyfish and chum salmon. Jellyfish abundance estimated from surface trawl surveys remained low from 2021 to 2022 (Yasumiishi et al., 2022c); estimates from the bottom trawl survey increased 75% from 2021 to 2022 and have been variable over the past 5 years (Buser, 2022). Chum salmon abundance has been declining in the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim Region since 2017 to their lowest level in the time series in 2021 (Liller, 2021), a trend also reflected in the commercial harvest data (Whitehouse, 2022b).

**Summary for Environmental/Ecosystem considerations**

- The extended warm phase experienced by the EBS that began in approximately 2014 has largely relaxed to normal conditions over the past year (August 2021 - August 2022). 

- The 2022 cold pool spatial extent was near the historical average. 

- The 2022 spring bloom peak timing was average over the southern shelf; chlorophyll-a biomass varied spatially over the shelf.

- The 2022 coccolithophore index was among the highest ever observed 

- Reduced overall zooplankton productivity in the south in spring and late- summer 2022; euphausiid abundances higher than recent years. In the north, small copepods declined while large copepods and euphausiids were more abundant than in recent years.

- In the south, juvenile pollock had above-average condition in 2022, continuing a trend of positive condition anomalies since 2016, while adult pollock had below-average condition, which has also been the case since 2015 (except 2019). In the north, both juvenile and adult pollock had slightly below-average condition.

- Trends in potential competitors are mixed over the shelf, with record high run size of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon and run failures of across western Alaska salmon stocks. The abundance of Pacific herring and juvenile sablefish increased, but their impact as competitors is not well understood at this time. 

- In 2022, with an average cold pool extent over the shelf, predation pressure from cannibalism may have been mitigated as adult pollock avoid the cold pool.

- Northern fur seal pup production at St. Paul Island in 2021 continued a declining trend since 1998.

- Trends in other potential predators are mixed over the shelf, with increased jellyfish abundance and decreased chum salmon abundance. 

Together, the most recent data available suggest an ecosystem risk Level 1 – Normal: 
“No apparent environmental/ecosystem concerns.”



#### Fishery performance

As noted above, the 2022 fishery improved over 2020 and 2021 and the
past concerns about small pollock in the fishery is alleviated. 
The fleet dispersion (the relative distance or spread
of the fishery in space) as shown in the past has indicated that
the seasonal dispersion levels were low (indicating relatively good fishing; 
Fig \ref{fig:fleet_dispersal}).

The CPUE of PSC species and other bycatch declined in 2022.
Sablefish, herring and Chinook salmon bycatch rates (per hour of
fishing) all decreased from 2021 (except for a slight increase in herring 
CPUE during the B season from low levels; Fig. \ref{fig:fsh_psc_cpue}).

The way the ABC control rule interacts with actual fishing is worth
considering. Specifically, given the 2 million t OY cap for all of
groundfish, when the EBS pollock stock is above target levels, the
fishing effort is lower (a lower *F*). As it approaches the target
($B_{MSY}$), it increases and then when it drops below, the fishing
mortality rate is ratcheted downwards rapidly. This can be exacerbated
when there are sudden unanticipated changes in survey estimates (like
what was apparently the case in 2021 which caused the retrospective pattern to degrade).
The mean weight-at-age for the 2021 B-season was near average, but in
general, pollock were skinny given their length. However, concerns over the
amount of 2-year old pollock in the 2020 fishery data has been ameliorated with
continued positive signs of that year-class which is projected to be an 
abundant number of 5-year olds in 2023. For this reason, we **conclude that 
that the fishery performance warrants a score of 1, normal: no apparent fishery performance
concerns.**

These results are summarized as:

```{=tex}
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{L{1.5in}L{1.5in}L{1.5in}L{1.5in} }
\hline
 \multicolumn{4}{c}{Considerations}   \\

Level 1: Normal & Level 1: Normal  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
```
Having a score at level 2 suggests that adjustments to the ABC may be prudent.
In the past, the SSC has considered factors similar to those presented
above and selected an ABC based on Tier 3 estimates. Last year the SSC
requested examining Tier 2 values as an alternative. 
Unlike Tier 3, using Tier 2 would have a constant buffer relative to the Tier 1 value
(at about 11%). Setting the ABC to Tier 3 levels provides a very large buffer but one that
could be warrented given that the impact on subsequent spawning biomass levels will
be much more variable and have a high probability of dropping below the target stock 
size and result in much reduced future ABCs under the current FMP.
It is worth noting that fishing at the full Tier 1 ABC would imply
a more than doubling of effort and well exceed the 2 million t groundfish catch limit.
Even fishing at a full Tier 3 ABC shows there is a relatively high probability of 
falling below $B_{MSY}$ values or proxies thereof. Under our standard scenarios, Alternative
3 shows trajectories if fishing effort is held equal to the recent 5-year average. It is
noteworthy that this provides stock sizes that have a good probability of being above targets
and avoiding drastic reductions in yeild (lower overall variability in ABC/yields;
Fig. \ref{fig:tier3_proj_alt3} ). 


The SSC has requested "an explicit set of concerns that explain the ABC
adjustment." In response, we direct attention to the decision table
\ref{tab:dec_table}) and the fact that the biological basis for the
continued stock productivity has most to do with the OY constraint which
has effectively maintained fishery production at around 1.3 million t
since 1990. Demonstrations that would allow fishing to near $F_{MSY}$
catch quantities would show that catch variability would be extremely
high (and unrealistic given current capacity and OY limits for combined
BSAI groundfish; Ianelli 2005). Furthermore, the frequency of being at
much lower spawning stock sizes would be much higher, and would likely
be riskier and fishing effort would need to be much higher. While the
biological basis for ABC setting is founded in sound conservation of
spawning biomass, the history of the current fishery productivity should
inform desirable biomass. In only 6 of the 41 years since 1981 has the
stock been below the $B_{MSY}$ level (15% of the years). The mean
spawning biomass over this period has averaged about
`r round(100*(mean(M$SSB[M$SSB[,1]>1980,2])/M$bmsy-1),0)`% higher than
the estimated $B_{MSY}$. In terms of an actual "management target", Punt
et al. (2013) developed some robust estimators for $B_{MEY}$ (Maximum
Economic Yield) noting that a typical target would be
1.2$\times B_{MSY}$ or about
`r round((mean(M$SSB[M$SSB[,1]>1980,2])/(1.2*M$bmsy)-1)*100,0)`% lower
than the mean value or a target female spawning biomass at
`r round(1.2*M$bmsy/1000,3)` million t. It therefore seems worth
considering developing an explicit harvest control rule that achieves
the level of productivity observed over the past 30 years.

In recent years when the pollock biomass was estimated to be well above
average, the catch was constrained by other factors. Specifically, the 2
million t BSAI groundfish catch limit and bycatch avoidance measures has
an impact on the potential for large increases in catch. As the stock is
presently estimated to be below 
$B_{MSY}$, the maximum permissible ABC
under the FMP can become the limiting factor for TAC specification.
Unfortunately, this ABC can ratchet down quickly because as the stock
declines further below this target stock size, the ABC fishing mortality
rate is adjusted downwards nearly proportionately. This part of the FMP
control rule can create high variability in the TAC. Less variability in
the catch, accordingly, would also result in less spawning stock
variability and reduce risks to the fishery should the period of poor
recruitment continue. 

To more fully evaluate these considerations
performance indicators as modified from Ianelli et al. (2012) were
developed to evaluate some near-term risks given alternative `r nextyr`
catch values. These indicators and rationale for including them are
summarized in Table \ref{tab:dec_tab_rationale}). Model 20 (the "base") results
for these indicators are provided in Table \ref{tab:dec_table}. Each
column of this table uses a fixed `r nextyr` catch and assumes the same
effort for the four additional projection years
(`r nextyr+1`--`r nextyr+4`). Given this specification , there is a low
probability that any of the catches shown in the first row would exceed
the $F_{MSY}$ level. Also, in the near term it appears unlikely that the
spawning stock will be below $B_{MSY}$ (rows 3 and 4). Relative to the
historical mean spawning biomass, by `r nextyr` it is more likely than
not that the spawning biomass will be lower than the historical mean
(fifth row). The range of catches examined have relatively small or no
impact on the age diversity indicators. However, for catch to equal the
2021 value, more fishing effort will likely be required and there is a
good chance that the proportion of the stock less than age 6 will be
greater than the historical average. In terms of catch advice, the
results presented in the decision table indicates that catches above 1.0
million t will very likely result in `r nextyr+1` spawning stock
estimates being below the long term mean (but above $B_{MSY}$).

In the past, another approach/rationale for stabilizing effort by setting the
fishing mortality equal to the current year. Doing so this year suggests 
setting the fishing mortality to `r thisyr` levels results in a catch of
`r M$abc1constFs` kt. Given the revisions to last year's model results and 
the positive increases in stock size, maintaining a constant fishing mortality
rate seems unnecessary at this time.

# Additional ecosystem considerations {#Additional_ecosystem}

In general, a number of key issues for ecosystem conservation and
management can be highlighted. These include:

-   Preventing overfishing;

-   Avoiding habitat degradation;

-   Minimizing incidental bycatch;

-   Monitoring bycatch and the level of discards; and

-   Considering multi-species trophic interactions relative to harvest
    policies.

For the case of pollock in the Eastern Bering Sea, the NPFMC and NMFS
continue to manage the fishery on the basis of these issues in addition
to the single- species harvest approach (Hollowed et al. 2011). The
prevention of overfishing is clearly set out as the main guideline for
management. Habitat degradation has been minimized in the pollock
fishery by converting the industry to pelagic-gear only. Bycatch in the
pollock fleet is closely monitored by the NMFS observer program and
managed on that basis. Discard rates of many species have been reduced
in this fishery and efforts to minimize bycatch continue.

In comparisons of the Western Bering Sea (WBS) with the Eastern Bering
Sea using mass-balance food-web models based on 1980--85 summer diet
data, Aydin et al. (2002) found that the production in these two systems
is quite different. On a per-unit-area measure, the western Bering Sea
has higher productivity than the EBS. Also, the pathways of this
productivity are different with much of the energy flowing through
epifaunal species (e.g., sea urchins and brittlestars) in the WBS
whereas for the EBS, crab and flatfish species play a similar role. In
both regions, the keystone species in 1980--85 were pollock and Pacific
cod. This study showed that the food web estimated for the EBS ecosystem
appears to be relatively mature due to the large number of
interconnections among species. In a more recent study based on 1990--93
diet data, pollock remain in a central role in the ecosystem. The diet of
pollock is similar between adults and juveniles with the exception that
adults become more piscivorous (with consumption of pollock by adult
pollock representing their third largest prey item).

Regarding specific small-scale ecosystems of the EBS, Ciannelli et al.
(2004a, 2004b) presented an application of an ecosystem model scaled to
data available around the Pribilof Islands region. They applied
bioenergetics and foraging theory to characterize the spatial extent of
this ecosystem. They compared energy balance, from a food web model
relevant to the foraging range of northern fur seals and found that a
range of 100 nautical mile radius encloses the area of highest energy
balance representing about 50% of the observed foraging range for
lactating fur seals. This has led to a hypothesis that fur seals depend
on areas outside the energetic balance region. This study develops a
method for evaluating the shape and extent of a key ecosystem in the EBS
(i.e., the Pribilof Islands). Furthermore, the overlap of the pollock
fishery and northern fur seal foraging habitat has been identified (see
Sterling and Ream 2004, Zeppelin and Ream 2006).

A brief summary of these two perspectives (ecosystem effects on pollock
stock and pollock fishery effects on ecosystem) is given in (Table
\ref{tab:ecosys_tab}). Unlike the food-web models discussed above,
examining predators and prey in isolation may overly simplify
relationships. This table serves to highlight the main connections and
the status of our understanding or lack thereof.

## Ecosystem effects on the EBS pollock stock

The pollock stock trends appear to be responding to ecosystem conditions
in the EBS. The conditions on the shelf during 2008 apparently affected
age-0 northern rock sole due to cold conditions and apparently
unfavorable currents that retain them into the over- summer nursery
areas (Cooper et al. 2014). It may be that such conditions favor pollock
recruitment. Hollowed et al. (2012) provided an extensive review of
habitat and density for age-0 and age-1 pollock based on survey data.
They noted that during cold years, age-0 pollock were distributed
primarily in the outer domain in waters greater than 1$^\circ$C and
during warm years, age-0 pollock were distributed mostly in the middle
domain. This temperature relationship, along with interactions with
available food in early-life stages, appears to have important
implications for pollock recruitment success (Coyle et al. 2011).

A separate section presented again this year updates a multispecies
model with more recent data and is presented as a supplement to the BSAI
SAFE report. This approach incorporates a number of simplifications for
the individual species data and fisheries processes (e.g., constant
fishery selectivity and the use of design-based survey indices for
biomass). However, that model mimics the biomass levels and trends with
the single species reasonably well. It also allows specific questions to
be addressed regarding pollock TACs. For example, since predation (and
cannibalism) is explicitly modeled, the impact of relative stock sizes
on subsequent recruitment to the fishery can be now be directly
estimated and evaluated (in the model presented here, cannibalism is
explicitly accounted for in the assumed Ricker stock-recruit
relationship).

## EBS pollock fishery effects on the ecosystem.

Since the pollock fishery is primarily pelagic in nature, the bycatch of
non- target species is small relative to the magnitude of the fishery
(Table \ref{tab:nontargbycatch}). Jellyfish represent the largest
component of the bycatch of non-target species and had averaged around
5--6 kt per year but more than doubled in 2014, then dropping again in
2015. The 2018 value was high, dropped and then was again high in 2021.
The data on non-target species shows a high degree of inter-annual
variability, which reflects the spatial variability of the fishery and
high observation error. This variability may reduce the ability to
detect significant trends for bycatch species.

The catch of other target species in the pollock fishery (defined as any
trawl set where the catch represents more than 80% of the catch)
represents about 1% of the total pollock catch. Incidental catch of
Pacific cod has varied but after a period of low catch levels it
increased to over 9,000 t in 2020 and 2021 but in 2022 was under
4 thousand t (Table \ref{tab:fmpbycatch}). There
has been a marked increase in the incidental catch of Pacific ocean
perch in the since 2014 with a peak just under 8 thousand t in 2019. 
The incidental catch of sablefish peaked in 2020 at about 3.5 thousand t
but was less that 300 t in 2022.
The incidental catch of pollock in other target fisheries is more than 
double the bycatch of
target species in the pollock fishery with the largest pollock catches
in the yellofin sole and Pacific cod fisheries (Table \ref{tab:pollbycatch}).

The number of non-Chinook salmon (nearly all made up of chum salmon)
taken incidentally varies considerably over time. 
  increased since 2014 with the 2017
number in excess of 465 thousand fish, the third highest non-Chinook salmon
bycatch that's been observed since 1991. Since then, 7 of the top 10 highest
bycatch years have occurred with nearly 550 thousand taken in 2021 (Table
\ref{tab:pscbycatch}). Chinook salmon bycatch has varied (42\% CV since 2011)
and averaged just under 19 thousand fish from 2011-2022  (Table \ref{tab:pscbycatch}). 
After a recent high bycatch of over 32,000 fish in 2020, the 2022 bycatch
was just over 6,400 Chinook salmon. 
Ianelli and Stram (2014) provided estimates of
the bycatch impact on Chinook salmon runs to the coastal west Alaska
region and found that the peak bycatch levels exceeded 7% of the total
run return. Since 2011, the impact has been estimated to be below 2%.
Updated estimates given new genetic information and these levels of PSC
as provided to the Council continue to suggest that the impact is low.

# Data gaps and research priorities

The available data for EBS pollock are extensive yet many processes
behind the observed patterns continue to be poorly understood.\
The recent patterns of abundance observed in the northern Bering Sea
provide an example. As such, we recommend the following research
priorities:

-   Support developing a team of analysts to evaluate all aspects of the 
    current model against alternatives (e.g., Rceattle, WHAM, Stock Synthesis, etc.).

-   Continue to investigate using spatial processes for estimation
    purposes (e.g., combining acoustic and bottom trawl survey data).
    The application of the geostatistical methods seems like a
    reasonable approach to statistically model disparate data sources
    for generating better abundance indices. Also, examine the potential
    to use pelagic samples from the BASIS survey to inform recruitment
    and subsequent spatial patterns.

-   Develop methods to use spatio-temporal models to estimate
    composition information (specifically, weight-at-age in the survey).

-   Study the relationship between climate and recruitment and trophic
    interactions of pollock within the ecosystem. This would be useful
    for improving ways to evaluate the current and alternative fishery
    management systems. In particular, a careful re-evaluation of the current
    FMP harvest control rule should be undertaken.

-  Exploration of alternative methods for estimating time-varying
   selectivity-at-age, in particular where the variance is estimated jointly
   with identifying the effective sample size of associated composition data.
   Properly weighting fishery and survey age-composition data is likely to be
   important for interpreting the strength of the 2018 year class again in the
   2023 assessment.

-   Apply new technologies (e.g., bottom-moored echosounders) to
    evaluate pollock movement between regions and supplement this work
    with analytical approaches.

-   Expand genetic sample collections for pollock (and process available
    samples) and apply high resolution genetic tools for stock structure
    analyses.
