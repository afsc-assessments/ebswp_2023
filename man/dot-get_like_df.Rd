\title{Extract Likelihood Data Frame}
\usage{
.get_like_df(M)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{A list of models where each model contains likelihood components.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the likelihood components, model name,
natural mortality value (M), and negative log likelihood (NLL) for each model in the list.
}
\description{
This function extracts likelihood values from a list of models and
formats them into a structured data frame.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'model_list' is a list of models with the appropriate structure
# likelihood_df <- .get_like_df(model_list)
}
