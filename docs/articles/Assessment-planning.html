<ul>
<li>
<p>The SSC would prefer not to make a risk table adjustment based on
the difference from Tier 1 to Tier 3 again during the 2024 assessment
cycle. The SSC requests that the next stock assessment bring back a new
approach that may include development of a constant buffer based on
factors extrinsic to the stock assessment (ecosystem function), or a
better representation of the uncertainty in the Tier 1 and control rule
calculations such that a reduction from maximum ABC is not needed every
year.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Will approach this with a discussion of alternative HCRs for
pollock that consider ecosystem function. Re-examine what was done in
2011, consider a proper alternative feedback approach, noting that the
early work including climate change.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use posterior distributions from the MCMC to determine
probabilities in the risk table and expand the columns in the risk table
to include the recommended ABC (and potentially higher values).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Just requires some code modifications to do the computations off
of the posteriors</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify where MLE estimates are being used and where MCMC
estimates are being used. Also see the SSC’s General Stock Assessment
Comments to include convergence diagnostics any time Bayesian results
are reported. If MCMC diagnostics continue to appear adequate, reference
points could be calculated using the posterior distribution used, rather
than an analytical calculation.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>MLE is used and asymptotic approximations are used everywhere
for advice, MCMC has been used as a comparison only and to show
inter-relationships. Just requires some code modifications to do the
computations off of the posteriors</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSC recommends that consideration be given to removal of the
Japanese fishery CPUE index (1965-76) from the assessment, because this
data set no longer seems to contribute to the assessment. A sensitivity
test should be done to evaluate the effects of data removal on the
assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Will investigate. In 1964 data suggests all young small fish
from the north, these data are handed down, issues about catching being
not represenative of population, doesn’t impact much, makes it hard to
get different assessment models running so may make sense to
remove</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Catch-at-age data provided by foreign fishing agencies in the
pre-Magnuson era were not produced using the same aging criteria as the
AFSC age-and-growth program. Consideration should be given to removal of
these data from the assessment. A sensitivity test should be done to
evaluate the effects of data removal on the assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Will investigate, age-determination methods from historical
records and/or Russian scientists.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document the method used for determining the selectivity to use
in the forward projections and continue to evaluate projection
variability due to selectivity. The SSC appreciates the selectivity
retrospective comparison and suggests that it might be helpful to limit
the comparison to the projection used in each year against only the most
recent (best) estimate of selectivity for that year.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Better document selectivity assumptions for projections. Look at
Cole’s approach for plotting out performance. Consider historical
uncertainty and variability.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSC supports the use of posterior predictive distributions,
an underutilized tool in fisheries science, but common in other fields.
To fully implement this approach to Bayesian model checking the SSC
recommends plotting a histogram for each data source of the percentile
of the predictive distribution in which each data point lies, noting
that in a highly consistent model this histogram would be uniform.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>This conclusion might be incorrect. Likely to write that this
will evolve into better approaches to include in the future</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an apparent shift towards older ages in fisheries and
trawl survey selectivity that should be investigated further.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Will investigate, focused around changes in
availabilty.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSC agrees with the BSAI GPT’s proposal in their presentation
to move the multi-species model out of the pollock stock assessment,
where it has been included as an appendix since it was first developed.
Instead, they suggested it would be a separate chapter listed in
parallel with the ESR, as it applies to multiple stocks and informs the
ESRs.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Technically it’s presented as part of the BSAI assessment. Agree
that it should be highlighted on its own.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSC suggests revisiting the treatment of the stock-recruit
relationship in the assessment model using recent improvements in
modeling approaches and a longer time series that encompasses the recent
warm period in the EBS. Recruitment deviates should be from the
stock-recruit relationship and should model variability among annual
recruitment estimates based on information in the data and residual
variability. The estimation process should ensure that log-normally
distributed recruitments are mean unbiased, resulting in unbiased
biomass estimates. If an informative prior is used for steepness, it
should be based on a meta-analysis of related species and reflect the
uncertainty of that meta-analysis. Further consideration of time periods
(as in previous analyses) and the influence of temperature on the
stock-recruit relationship may be helpful. The SSC recognizes that there
were significant recent analyses in 2016, 2018 and 2020 and is not
requesting a repeat of those but a review of previous work would be
helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Will include a review and a re-parameterization of numbers at
age 1 being from the SRR. We will take this in steps, and unclear about
“recent warm periods”. </em></li>

</h3>
<p>thinking on arguments for a EBS pollock “maintain ecosystem function”
catch-advice rule as requested by the SSC. I think I mentioned something
about management that provides a forage base (say of 1-3 yr old pollock)
and avoids low levels. Carey and I chatted earlier (added her to this
group) and realize that the estimates of these groups are relatively
unreliable (i.e., 1-3 yr olds for next year are typically poorly
estimated).</p>
<p>Within the FMP we’re talking about justification for catch advice
below the maximum permissible. So what about the following
semi-empirical approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What if catch advice is adjusted up and down relative the
historical mean biomass? I.e., if the catch in the current year is say
1.2 million t, and the SSB next year is 30% above the mean, then with a
regulator to dampen change, next year’s recommendation would be 1.2 *
(1.3)^0.5 =1.368 million t.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, if the SSB next year was only 75% of the mean value,
the recommendation would be 1.2 * (0.75)^0.5 =1.039 million t.</p></li>
<li><p>If the SSB stayed at 75% of the mean, then the following year
would be 1.039 * (.75)^0.5 = 0.8998 million t.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The rationale proposed is that the detrimental effects of fishing on
the ecosystem appear to be mainly sustainable.</p>
<p>Are there assignable issues from fishing affected the ecosystem
function that we’ve measured with any degree of confidence?</p>
<p>If there hadn’t been any pollock fishing ever, would we be able to
note that the ecosystem would be in a better state? Tuning the
adjustments based on historical catches and ecosystem outcomes would
generally be deemed “acceptable”</p>

<p><strong>The SSC suggests that walleye pollock is a good candidate for
considering the impacts of highly variable recruitment on reference
points in the context of the Council’s harvest control rules</strong>
(see discussion on working groups in the JGPT report section). For
example, the SAFE authors suggested exploring an explicit harvest
control rule that maintains productivity at the level observed over
recent decades (p. 33). The SSC supports considerations of modified
harvest control rules, particularly for stocks with highly variable and
uncertain recruitment. If the Council chooses, this could include
considerations for stabilizing catches over time or including other
economic considerations in the harvest control rules.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>For the 2023 assessment we examine the variability of the
biological reference points historically and note that there is general
stability in the

estimates. The Tier 1 ABC/OFL cthealculations can result in highly
variable estimates as the stock approaches

and drops below that value (as happend in the 2009-2010
period).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The SSC had the following additional recommendations for the
authors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maturity and growth information from the NBS has not been
examined yet. Given the possible importance of the NBS to walleye
pollock and other species in the future, the SSC suggests this should be
a high priority.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>These data being processed and this work is underway</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSC supports efforts to implement recent advances in
improving the statistical treatment of compositional data using the
Dirichlet distribution or other approaches.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tradeoffs in data weighting were pursued in September 2023 and
saught to find a balance between observation error and process
errors</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SAFE document lists a number of research recommendations (p.
36/37). The SSC notes that some of these are at least in progress. The
SSC generally supports these recommendations but requests that the
authors update the list of priorities to clarify to what extent some of
these priorities have been partially or fully addressed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>We updated the priorities and listed those that have been
completed or are continued to be underway</em>”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular, the SSC notes that genetic sample collection and
analyses are listed as a research priority across all pollock stocks and
that some work has been completed. The SSC highlights the importance of
additional genetics work and would appreciate an update on the status of
this work either as part of the assessment or separately.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>We revisited the stock structure work attached as an appendix to
the 2015 SAFE report chapter and are examining the extent that this work
needs updating. </em>”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSC appreciated the adjustments to weight-at-age in the
survey that was included in this year’s assessment and suggests that
these changes may be substantial enough to warrant an examination of
their impact on assessment results.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>This publication has been completed and in the present
assessment we evaluated the implication of alternative spawning
biomass-at-age assumptions.</em>”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>With respect to the multi-species CEATTLE model, the SSC concurs
with Plan Team recommendations to use the model to inform risk table
discussions and to consider ways in which model outputs, in particular
estimates of predation mortality, can inform single-species
assessments.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We wil include a more thorough evaluation and discussion in the
2023 assessment.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSC encourages the authors to consider model-based solutions
to uncertain recruitment estimates rather than ad-hoc adjustments. In
particular, reductions in the assumed recruitment variance parameter may
result in less extreme recruitment estimates. Other systematic
approaches to addressing the uncertainty may also be considered.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We revisited applying the age-determination error matrix as a
sensitivity as this can impact the recruitment variability and
estimation uncertainty.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSC suggests that authors include a plot to compare estimates
of recent recruitments as they change over time similar to Fig 3.33 (pg.
88) in the sablefish assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>We provide a figure of estimated recruitment by year class (1977
– 2019) in number of age-1 fish (billions of fish) for the 2022 and 2023
models.</em> ”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSC supports the move across assessment from design-based
estimates of survey biomass to VAST estimates. The SSC recommends that
the design-based estimates be produced as a check on VAST estimates and
as a fallback option if needed, although they may not need to be
included in the assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We provide a table showing the design-based estimates and
conduct a model run with those estimates. This may be an approach to
adopt so that bridging across assessment modeling platforms can be
facilitated (most other assessment model platforms are unable to deal
with index time series that have a covariance matrix)</em></li>

within the assessment model and the large change in the estimated 2021
