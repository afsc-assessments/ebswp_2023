</h3>
<p><strong>The SSC suggests that walleye pollock is a good candidate for
considering the impacts of highly variable recruitment on reference
points in the context of the Council’s harvest control rules</strong>
(see discussion on working groups in the JGPT report section). For
example, the SAFE authors suggested exploring an explicit harvest
control rule that maintains productivity at the level observed over
recent decades (p. 33). The SSC supports considerations of modified
harvest control rules, particularly for stocks with highly variable and
uncertain recruitment. If the Council chooses, this could include
considerations for stabilizing catches over time or including other
economic considerations in the harvest control rules.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>For the 2023 assessment we examine the variability of the
biological reference points historically and note that there is general
stability in the <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span> estimates.
The Tier 1 ABC/OFL cthealculations can result in highly variable
estimates as the stock approaches <span class="math inline">\(B_{MSY}\)</span> and drops below that value (as
happend in the 2009-2010 period).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The SSC had the following additional recommendations for the
authors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maturity and growth information from the NBS has not been
examined yet. Given the possible importance of the NBS to walleye
pollock and other species in the future, the SSC suggests this should be
a high priority.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>These data being processed and this work is underway</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSC supports efforts to implement recent advances in
improving the statistical treatment of compositional data using the
Dirichlet distribution or other approaches.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tradeoffs in data weighting were pursued in September 2023 and
saught to find a balance between observation error and process
errors</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SAFE document lists a number of research recommendations (p.
36/37). The SSC notes that some of these are at least in progress. The
SSC generally supports these recommendations but requests that the
authors update the list of priorities to clarify to what extent some of
these priorities have been partially or fully addressed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>We updated the priorities and listed those that have been
completed or are continued to be underway</em>”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular, the SSC notes that genetic sample collection and
analyses are listed as a research priority across all pollock stocks and
that some work has been completed. The SSC highlights the importance of
additional genetics work and would appreciate an update on the status of
this work either as part of the assessment or separately.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>We revisited the stock structure work attached as an appendix to
the 2015 SAFE report chapter and are examining the extent that this work
needs updating. </em>”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSC appreciated the adjustments to weight-at-age in the
survey that was included in this year’s assessment and suggests that
these changes may be substantial enough to warrant an examination of
their impact on assessment results.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>This publication has been completed and in the present
assessment we evaluated the implication of alternative spawning
biomass-at-age assumptions.</em>”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>With respect to the multi-species CEATTLE model, the SSC concurs
with Plan Team recommendations to use the model to inform risk table
discussions and to consider ways in which model outputs, in particular
estimates of predation mortality, can inform single-species
assessments.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We wil include a more thorough evaluation and discussion in the
2023 assessment.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSC encourages the authors to consider model-based solutions
to uncertain recruitment estimates rather than ad-hoc adjustments. In
particular, reductions in the assumed recruitment variance parameter may
result in less extreme recruitment estimates. Other systematic
approaches to addressing the uncertainty may also be considered.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We revisited applying the age-determination error matrix as a
sensitivity as this can impact the recruitment variability and
estimation uncertainty.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSC suggests that authors include a plot to compare estimates
of recent recruitments as they change over time similar to Fig 3.33 (pg.
88) in the sablefish assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>We provide a figure of estimated recruitment by year class (1977
– 2019) in number of age-1 fish (billions of fish) for the 2022 and 2023
models.</em> ”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSC supports the move across assessment from design-based
estimates of survey biomass to VAST estimates. The SSC recommends that
the design-based estimates be produced as a check on VAST estimates and
as a fallback option if needed, although they may not need to be
included in the assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We provide a table showing the design-based estimates and
conduct a model run with those estimates. This may be an approach to
adopt so that bridging across assessment modeling platforms can be
facilitated (most other assessment model platforms are unable to deal
with index time series that have a covariance matrix)</em></li>

<li><p>Exploration of young-of-year pollock density and quality
estimates from NMFS BASIS surveys to inform pollock
recruitment.</p></li>
<li><p>Consideration of whether the observed sensitivity in the SRR to
prior specification should constitute an increased risk level
specification within the assessment or population dynamicsrelated
considerations. This could provide a clearer justification for the use
of the Tier 3 calculation as the basis for harvest
specification.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the time-varying specification of fishery selectivity
within the assessment model and the large change in the estimated 2021
FOFL between the 2019 and 2020 assessments, the authors should provide a
retrospective comparison of the selectivity assumed in projections to
that estimated with the addition of new data.</p></li>
<li><p>Consideration of whether risk table specifications should account
for the importance of pollock as a key forage species in the EBS
ecosystem to better justify the use of a Tier 3 ABC determination as a
precautionary measure for this Tier 1 stock.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the apparent disappearance of the second and large mode in
fishery length compositions as the 2020 B-season progressed, exploration
of within-season spatial variation in fishery length composition would
be useful in evaluating whether these larger pollock simply moved out of
the area of fishing effort, or died as a result of natural or fishing
mortality.</p></li>
