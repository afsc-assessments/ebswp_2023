# EBSpollock
An attempt to make assessments more transparent!

## The SSC continues to support:
  * Ongoing genetic studies to determine the relationship between pollock in the NBS and EBS, and nearby GOA and AI regions.

  * The 2019 BSAI GPT recommendation to revisit and evaluate the treatment of variance parameters 
	   within the assessment, with particular attention to those that are fixed.

  * Efforts to quantify pollock movement and abundance along the US-Russia EEZ boundary.

  * Geostatistical analyses of combined trawl and acoustic data to provide a single time-series,
    statistically accounting for the overlap between these data, for informing stock trends.

## The SSC provides the following additional recommendations:
  * Exploration of young-of-year pollock density and quality estimates from NMFS BASIS surveys to inform pollock recruitment.

  * Consideration of whether the observed sensitivity in the SRR to prior specification should
constitute an increased risk level specification within the assessment or population dynamicsrelated considerations. This could provide a clearer justification for the use of the Tier 3 calculation
as the basis for harvest specification.

  * Given the time-varying specification of fishery selectivity within the assessment model and the
large change in the estimated 2021 FOFL between the 2019 and 2020 assessments, the authors should
provide a retrospective comparison of the selectivity assumed in projections to that estimated with
the addition of new data.

  * Consideration of whether risk table specifications should account for the importance of pollock as
a key forage species in the EBS ecosystem to better justify the use of a Tier 3 ABC determination
as a precautionary measure for this Tier 1 stock.

  * Given the apparent disappearance of the second and large mode in fishery length compositions as
the 2020 B-season progressed, exploration of within-season spatial variation in fishery length
composition would be useful in evaluating whether these larger pollock simply moved out of the
area of fishing effort, or died as a result of natural or fishing mortality.
